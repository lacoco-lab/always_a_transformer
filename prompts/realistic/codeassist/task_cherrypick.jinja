Below is a part of a Git commit history (newest at the top, oldest at the bottom).

Task  
List every commit line that must be cherry‑picked onto the release branch.  
1. Output them **from oldest to newest** (the order `git cherry‑pick` expects).  
2. One complete commit line per output line.  
3. Do **not** output anything else.
