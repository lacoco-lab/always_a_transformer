The rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string. After going through the string from left to right, we find that the last 'w' is at the end of the string, but since there are multiple 'w's at the end, we identify the rightmost 'w' as the last character 'w' before the 'r's at the very end.\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is 'r'.\n\nHowever, since the options provided are digits (0 or 1), and the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is 'r', not a digit, we must re-evaluate our approach based on the provided options. Given the task's constraints and the options available, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the task's description or in interpreting the task's requirements based on the provided options.\n\nHowever, strictly following the task as described and the options provided, since there's no digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' but rather an 'r', and given the options are A (0) or B (1), and without a clear digit to choose from directly after the last 'w', the task as described does not align with the options provided.\n\nGiven the task's constraints and the misunderstanding, I will proceed under the assumption that the task requires identifying a digit based on the pattern or the presence of 'w' and 'r' in the string, which isn't directly answerable with the provided options without further clarification.\n\nHowever, to adhere to the format requested and acknowledging the confusion:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string. 0fter going through the string from left to right, we find that the last 'w' is at the end of the string, but since there are multiple 'w's at the end, we identify the rightmost 'w' as the last character in the sequence of 'w's at the end.\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is not present since the 'w' is at the end of the string. However, upon closer inspection, we realize that the string actually ends with a sequence of characters, and the last 'w' is indeed followed by no digit but is the last 'w' in a sequence of 'w's. The last 'w' is actually followed by no character because it is the last 'w' in the string and there are no more characters after it. However, looking at the string again, we see that the last 'w' is indeed the last character in a sequence of 'w's but there are characters after the sequence of 'w's that immediately precede the last 'w'. The last 'w' is actually the last character in the string, but there are characters before it that are not 'w'.
