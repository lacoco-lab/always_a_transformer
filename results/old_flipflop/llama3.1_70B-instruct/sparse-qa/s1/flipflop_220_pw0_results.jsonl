Check the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's apply this to the given string:\n\nInput: w0i1i0i1i0i1w0i1r0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1w1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i0w1i1w1i1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i0w1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0w1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1r\n\nStarting from the end and scanning backwards, the rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
