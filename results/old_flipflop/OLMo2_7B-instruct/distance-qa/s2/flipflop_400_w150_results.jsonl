Identify the position of the 'w' character in the string.\n2. Determine the digit immediately to the right of this 'w' character.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the 'w':\n\nInput string: w0i0r0r0r0i1r0i1i0i0i1i0i0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1i1i0r0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0r0w0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0r0r0i1r0i0r0i1i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0r0i1i1i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i0r0r0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0i1r0i1i1r0r0i0r0i1i1i1r0r\n\nThe 'w' character appears at the 37th position in the string.\n\nNext, we need to find the digit immediately to the right of this 'w'. We will iterate through the string from the 36th position onward (since positions are 1-indexed) and identify the first digit encountered.\n\nLet's write a Python code snippet to perform this task:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i0r0r0r0i1r0i1i0i0i1i0i0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0r0r0i1r0i0r0i1i0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0i0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0r0i1i1i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i0r0r0i0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0\"\n\n# Find the position of the 'w' character\nw_position = input_string.find('w')\n\n# Iterate from the position after 'w' to find the first digit\nfor i in range(w_position + 1, len(input_string)):\n    if input_string[i].isdigit():\n        right_digit = int(input_string[i])\n        break\n\n# Output the result\nanswer = \"<answer>\" + right_digit + \"</answer>"}

Increment the position variable each time we encounter a 'w'.\n4. Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', get the character at that position.\n5. Convert the character to its corresponding digit (if it is a digit) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Initialize the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    rightmost_w_pos = -1\n    \n    # Iterate through the string from right to left\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            rightmost_w_pos = i\n            break\n    \n    # Get the character at the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    character = input_string[rightmost_w_pos]\n    \n    # Convert the character to a digit (if it is a digit)\n    if character.isdigit():\n        digit = int(character)\n    else:\n        digit = 0  # If it's not a digit, default to 0\n    \n    return digit\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i0i0i1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1r1r1i0w0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i0i0r0r0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i0i0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i0i0r0r0r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i0r0r0i1r0r\"\n\n# Find and print the digit after the rightmost 'w'\nanswer = \"<answer>B</answer>"}

Initialize a variable `lastPosition` to keep track of the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (to find the rightmost 'w').\n3. If the current character is 'w', update `lastPosition` to the current position.\n4. After the loop, `lastPosition` will hold the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n5.
