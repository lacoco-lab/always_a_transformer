Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of that 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\n- The string is composed of several groups of characters, each group separated by 'r'.\n- Each group contains a mix of digits and characters, but the pattern is consistent: a digit, followed by 'r', followed by a mix of characters.\n\nTo find the position of the last 'w', we need to count the number of 'r' separators and the length of each group before the last 'w'. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- The first group: `w1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0i1i0i0i1r1r1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1r1i0i0i0r1r1i1r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1i0i1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0i0w1r`\n\n- The second group: `w1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0i1i0i0i1r1r1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0w1r`\n\n- The third group: `w1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0i1i0i0i1r1r1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1i0i0i0w1r`\n\nThe third group is the last group, and it ends with 'w'. The position of the last 'w' is determined by counting the 'r' separators and the characters before it.\n\nLet's count:\n- There are 3 'r' separators in the third group.\n- The length of the third group (excluding 'r') is 27 characters.\n\nThus, the 'w' is the 28th character in the string.\n\nNow, we need to find the digit directly to the right of the 28th character. Counting from the right:\n- The 28th character is 'w'.\n- The 29th character is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
