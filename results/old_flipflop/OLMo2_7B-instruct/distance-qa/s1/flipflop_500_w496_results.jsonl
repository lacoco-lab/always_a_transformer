Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w'. The string is composed of alternating characters and numbers, with 'w' appearing in positions that follow a specific pattern. We can observe that 'w' appears after a sequence of 'r' characters and before a sequence of 'i' characters.\n\nTo find the position of the last 'w':\n- The sequence 'r' appears 7 times before the first 'w'.\n- The sequence 'i' appears 8 times after the first 'w'.\n- The sequence 'r' appears 7 times after each subsequent 'w'.\n- The sequence 'i' appears 8 times after each subsequent 'w'.\n\nThus, the position of the last 'w' can be calculated as follows:\n- The first 'w' is at position 7 (after 7 'r's) + 8 (for the 'i's) = 15.\n- Each subsequent 'w' is at a position that is 15 positions ahead of the previous 'w'.\n\nThe string length is 63 characters. We need to find the position of the last 'w' within this length:\n- The positions of the 'w's are: 15, 22, 39, 56, 73, 90, 107, 124, 141, 158, 175, 192, 209, 226, 243, 260, 277, 294, 311, 328, 345, 362, 379, 396, 413, 430, 447, 464, 481, 488, 495, 502, 509, 516, 523, 530, 537, 544, 551, 558, 565, 572, 579, 586, 593, 600, 607, 614, 621, 628, 635, 642, 649, 656, 663, 670, 677, 684, 691, 698, 705, 712, 719, 726, 733, 740, 747, 754, 761, 768, 775, 782, 789, 796, 803, 810, 817, 824, 831, 838, 845, 852, 859, 866, 873, 880, 887, 894, 901, 908, 915, 922, 929, 936, 943, 950, 957, 964, 971, 978, 985, 992.\n\nThe last 'w' is at position 992.\n\nTo find the digit directly to the right of this 'w', we look at position 993 in the string.\n\nThe digit at position 993 is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
