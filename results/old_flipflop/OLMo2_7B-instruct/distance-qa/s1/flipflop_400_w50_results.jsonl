Count spaces: There are 15 spaces.\n2. Count letters (excluding 'w'): There are 13 other letters.\n\nTotal characters before the last 'w': 15 (spaces) + 13 (letters) = 28 characters\n\nThis leaves us with 113 - 28 = 85 positions to fill with digits (0-9).\n\nSince we are looking for the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w', and considering the pattern of digits interspersed among the letters and spaces, the 85th digit (position 113 overall) is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
