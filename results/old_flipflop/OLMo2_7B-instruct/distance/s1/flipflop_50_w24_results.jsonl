Start at the end of the string: `r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r`\n2. Find the first 'w': `w1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r` -> `w1`\n   - `index` is now 1.\n3. Find the next 'w': `i1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r` -> `i1`\n   - `index` is now 2.\n4. Find the next 'w': `r1r1r1i0i0r0` -> `r1`\n   - `index` is now 3.\n5. The character at index 3 in the string `r1r1r1i0i0r0` is '0'.\n\nThus, the output digit is: <answer>0</answer>"}
