Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from right to left (since we need the digit after the **right most** 'w').\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment the counter.\n4. When the character is not 'w', output the counter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1r1r1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1i1r1i0r1i0w0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1i0r\"\n\n# Initialize counter\ncounter = 0\n\n# Iterate through the string from right to left\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        counter += 1\n\n# Output the result\noutput = \"<answer>\" + str(counter) + \"</answer>"}
