Iterate through the string from the rightmost character to the leftmost character (using negative indexing for Python).\n3. Increment `count` each time a 'w' is encountered.\n4. When the character is 'w', check if `count` is equal to the desired number of 'w' characters.\n5. If `count` equals the desired number, return the character at the current index (which is the rightmost 'w').\n6. If the end of the string is reached without finding the rightmost 'w', return a default value (e.g., '0').\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            count += 1\n            if count == 1:\n                return input_string[i]\n    return '0'  # Return a default value if no 'w' is found\n\ninput_string = \"w1i1i0r1r1i1i1i1i0i0i0r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i1i0r1i1i0r1i0r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1r1i1i1i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1i0r1i0r1i1r1i1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1i0r1i0r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i</answer>"}
