Continue this process until the entire string is processed.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w0i1i1i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i0r0w1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r0\n```\n\nApplying the algorithm:\n\n- Start from the right: 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', '0'\n- Counter is 0 (first 'r'), no 'w' found.\n- Move to the next character: '0'\n- Counter is 1 ('w' found), print '0'\n- Reset counter: 0\n- Move to the next character: 'i'\n- Counter is 0 ('w' not found), continue to the next character.\n- Repeat this process until the entire string is processed.\n\nFollowing this process, the output digit is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
