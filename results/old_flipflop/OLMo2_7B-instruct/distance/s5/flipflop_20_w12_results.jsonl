The position of the rightmost 'w' is determined by finding the length of the string minus 1 (since the rightmost character is at position 0).\n   - Length of \"w0i0r0r0r0r0w0r0r0r\" is 15.\n   - Therefore, the rightmost 'w' is at position 15 - 1 = 14.\n\n2. The character at position 14 in the string \"w0i0r0r0r0r0w0r0r0r\" is '0'.\n\n3. The digit of '0' is 0.\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
