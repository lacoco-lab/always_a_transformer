Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1 to keep track of the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If the character is 'w', update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n5. After iterating through the entire string, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n6. Convert `last_w_index` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    last_w_index = -1\n    for i, char in enumerate(input_string[::-1]):  # Iterate from the end to the beginning\n        if char == 'w':\n            last_w_index = i\n    return str(last_w_index + 1)  # Convert index to digit (0 or 1)\n\ninput_string = \"w1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i0i0i1r1r1i1i1r1i0i1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1i0r1i1r1i0i1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i0i0r1i0r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r</answer>"}

Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1 to keep track of the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If the character is 'w', update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n5. After iterating through the entire string, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n6. Convert `last_w_index` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    last_w_index = -1\n    for i, char in enumerate(input_string[::-1]):  # Iterate from the end to the beginning\n        if char == 'w':\n            last_w_index = i\n    return str(last_w_index + 1)  # Convert index to digit (0 or 1)\n\ninput_string = \"w1r1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1i1i1i1r1i1i0r1i0i0r1i1i1i1i0r1r1r1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r</answer>"}

Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of 'w' characters encountered.\n2. Iterate through the string from the rightmost character to the leftmost character (using negative indexing for Python).\n3. Increment `count` each time a 'w' is encountered.\n4. When a 'w' is not found (i.e., the iteration reaches the start of the string), the current value of `count` will be the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n5.
