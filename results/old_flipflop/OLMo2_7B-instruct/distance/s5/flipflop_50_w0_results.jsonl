Iterate through the string starting from the second character (since we are looking for the digit after the **right most** 'w') until we find the character 'w'.\n3. For each iteration, increment the `index` by 1.\n4. Check if the character at the current `index` is 'w'.\n5. If it is 'w', calculate the position of the next character by adding `index` to the length of the string (since we are looking for the digit after the 'w').\n6. Convert this position to a 1-based index (since Python uses 0-based indexing).\n7. Retrieve the character at this position.\n8. If the character is '0', return '0'. Otherwise, if it is '1', return '1'.\n9. If no 'w' is found or the character after the last 'w' is not '0' or '1', return an appropriate message indicating no valid digit found.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    index = 1  # Start from the second character\n    while True:\n        index += 1\n        if input_string[index] == 'w':\n            next_char_index = len(input_string) + index\n            next_char = input_string[next_char_index - 1]  # Convert to 1-based index\n            if next_char == '0':\n                return '<answer>0</answer>"}
