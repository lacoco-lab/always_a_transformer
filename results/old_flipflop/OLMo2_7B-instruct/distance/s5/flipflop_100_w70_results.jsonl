Continue this process until the entire string is processed.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0r0i1i0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1w0r0i0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i1i0\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Counter = 0\n2. Start iterating from the right: 'r0r0i1i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1w0r0i0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0'\n   - 'r0' -> Counter = 1\n   - 'r0' -> Counter = 2\n   - 'i0' -> Counter = 3\n   - 'r0r0' -> Counter = 4\n   - 'i1i0' -> Counter = 5\n   - 'r0r0' -> Counter = 6\n   - 'i1i1i0' -> Counter = 7\n   - 'r0r0' -> Counter = 8\n   - 'i1i1i1i0' -> Counter = 9\n   - 'r0r0' -> Counter = 10\n   - 'i0r0r0' -> Counter = 11\n   - 'i1r0i0r0' -> Counter = 12\n   - 'i1r0i0r0i1' -> Counter = 13\n   - 'i0r0r0r0' -> Counter = 14\n   - 'i0r0i1r0' -> Counter = 15\n   - 'i0r0r0r0r0' -> Counter = 16\n   - 'i1i0r0i1r0' -> Counter = 17\n   - 'i0r0i1r0i0' -> Counter = 18\n   - 'r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0' -> Counter = 19\n\n3. The counter is 19 when we encounter the 'w' character, so we print the digit at position 19.\n\nSince the string is 1-indexed, position 19 corresponds to the 18th character.\n\nThe 18th character in the input string is 'r0r0r0i1i0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the **rightmost** 'w' character is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n4. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `count`.\n5. When 'w' is encountered, determine the position of the next 'w' by adding `count` to `index`.\n6. If the next 'w' is found within the string, return the character at that position.\n7. If no 'w' is found after incrementing `index` by `count`, return the character at the current `index`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    index = len(input_string) - 1\n    count = 0\n    next_w_index = 0\n    \n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            count += 1\n        if count > 0:\n            next_w_index = index + count\n            if next_w_index < len(input_string):\n                return str(input_string[next_w_index])\n            else:\n                index += count\n                count = 0\n        else:\n            index -= 1\n    \n    return None  # If no 'w' is found after traversing the entire string\n\ninput_string = \"w0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i1r0i0r0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i0i1r0r0i0i1w1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r\"\noutput = find_digit_after_w(input_string)\n<answer></answer>"}
