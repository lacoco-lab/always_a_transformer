The string contains alternating 'r' and 'i' characters, followed by a single 'w' at the end.\n\n2. **Determine the position of 'w'**: Since 'w' is the last character in the string, its position is the length of the string minus 1.\n\n3. **Extract the digit after 'w'**: The characters after 'w' are only 'r' characters. Therefore, the digit after 'w' is the first 'r' following 'w'.\n\nGiven the string:\n```\nInput: w1r1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1r1i1r1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1w0i1i1r0i0i0r0r0i1i0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1i1i1r0i0r0r0i0i0r0i1i0i1r0i0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r\n```\n\n- The length of the string is 101.\n- The position of 'w' is `101 - 1 = 100`.\n- The characters after 'w' are 'r' characters only.\n\nThus, the digit after 'w' is the first 'r' following 'w', which is the 101st character in the string.\n\n**<answer>0</answer>"}
