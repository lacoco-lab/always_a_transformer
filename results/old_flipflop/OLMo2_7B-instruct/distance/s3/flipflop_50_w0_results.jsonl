If `index` is equal to `w` (the number of 'w' characters), return the character at the current position in the string.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0i1i0r0i1i0r0r0i1i0i0r0r0i1r0i0r0i0r0r0i0i1r0r\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize `index` to 0.\n2. Start iterating from the second character (index 1):\n   - Character at index 1: '0' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 2: 'i' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 3: '0' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 4: 'r' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 5: 'o' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 6: 'r' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 7: '0' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 8: 'r' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 9: 'o' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 10: 'r' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 11: '0' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 12: 'r' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 13: 'r' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 14: '0' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 15: 'r' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 16: '0' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 17: 'r' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 18: '0' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 19: 'r' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 20: '0' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 21: 'i' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 22: '1' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 23: 'i' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 24: '0' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 25: 'r' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 26: '0' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 27: 'r' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 28: '0' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 29: 'r' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 30: '0' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 31: 'i' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n   - Character at index 32: '1' (not 'w', so `index` remains 0)\n\nSince we have not found a 'w' character after the **right most** 'w' character (which is the 15th 'w'), the rightmost 'w' is at index 15. The character at index 15 is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Initialize a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the second character (index 1) until the end.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If the character is not 'w', check if `index` is equal to `w`. If it is, return the character at the current position (which is the digit after the **right most** 'w').\n5. If the loop completes without finding a 'w' at the current `index`, return `None` as there is no such digit.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string, w):\n    index = 1  # Start from the second character\n    for i in range(len(input_string)):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            index += 1\n        if input_string[i] != 'w' and index == w:\n            return input_string[i]\n        if index > len(input_string):  # No more 'w' characters\n            return None\n    return None\n\ninput_string = \"w0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1i1r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0r\"\nw = 5  # Example value for 'w', adjust as needed\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string, w)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
