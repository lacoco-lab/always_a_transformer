For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If the character is not 'w', check if `index` is equal to `w`. If it is, return the character at the current position (which is the digit after the **right most** 'w').\n5. If the loop completes without finding 'w', return a default value (e.g., 0) to indicate no 'w' was found after the specified number of 'w's.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string \"w1r1r1i0i0i1r1r1w1r\":\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string, w):\n    index = 1\n    current_char = input_string[index]\n    while index < len(input_string) and current_char != 'w':\n        index += 1\n    if index == w:\n        return input_string[index]\n    return 0\n\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1i0i0i1r1r1w1r\"\nw = 5\noutput = find_digit_after_w(input_string, w)\n<answer>1</answer>"}
