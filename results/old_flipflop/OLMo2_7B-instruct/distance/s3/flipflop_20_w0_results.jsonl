The rightmost 'w' in the string \"w1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r\" is at position 11 (0-indexed).\n2. Counting the characters after the rightmost 'w', we have 10 characters ('i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1').\n\nTherefore, the digit after the **rightmost** 'w' is the digit corresponding to the count of 10, which is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
