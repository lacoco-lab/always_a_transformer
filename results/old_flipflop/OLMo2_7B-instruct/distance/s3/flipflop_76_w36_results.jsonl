Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. When 'w' is encountered, check if `index` is equal to `w` (since we need the digit after the **rightmost** 'w').\n5. If `index` equals `w`, convert the character at that position to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    index = len(input_string) - 1  # Start from the rightmost character\n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            index -= 1  # Move to the right of the 'w'\n            if index >= 0:\n                return str(input_string[index])  # Return the digit at the current index\n\ninput_string = \"w0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0w0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r\"\nprint(<answer>)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the output digit.
