Iterate through the string from the rightmost character to the leftmost character (using negative indexing for Python).\n3. Increment `count` each time a 'w' is encountered.\n4. When the character is 'w', check if `count` is equal to the current index (which represents the rightmost occurrence of 'w').\n5. If they are equal, return the character at that index.\n6. If `count` exceeds the current index, continue the iteration.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    input_list = list(input_string)\n    \n    # Initialize count and index\n    count = 0\n    index = len(input_list) - 1  # Start from the last character\n    \n    # Iterate from the end to the beginning\n    while count < index:\n        if input_list[index] == 'w':\n            count += 1\n        index -= 1\n    \n    # Return the character at the rightmost 'w'\n    return input_list[index]\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0i0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r1i0r1r1r1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0i1r1i1i1r1r1r1i1i1w0i0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0i0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0i1r1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0i1r1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0i1r1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0i1i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i1i0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0i1r0r0i0r\"\n\n# Execute the function\noutput_digit = find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
