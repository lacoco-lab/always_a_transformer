Move to the next character and repeat the process until the end of the string is reached.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w0i1i1r0i0r0i1r0i0r0i0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1w1i0r1r1i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r1r1i1i0r\n```\n\nUsing the algorithm:\n\n1. Start at the end of the string: `r1r1i0r1i1i0i0r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r1r1i1i0r`\n2. Find the first 'w': `w1i0r1r1i1i0i0r1i0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r`\n3. Increment `index`: `1`\n4. The character at index 1 is 'i1'\n\nThus, the output digit is `<i1>` and </answer>"}
