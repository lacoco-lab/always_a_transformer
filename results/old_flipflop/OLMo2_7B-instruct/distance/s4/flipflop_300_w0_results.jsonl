We need to count how many characters (including '0') are there after the 'w' sequence until we reach the end of the string.\n\n   The 'r' and 'i' pattern repeats every 3 characters ('r', 'o', 'r'). The '0' after 'w' is the first character of this pattern.\n\n   The 'w' sequence is 16 characters long (from index 4 to 19 inclusive). The next character after 'w' is '0', and then the pattern 'ror' repeats.\n\n   The number of 'r' and 'i' characters in one cycle of 'ror' is 3. Since the 'w' sequence is 16 characters long, we have:\n   - 16 'w' characters\n   - 1 '0' character after 'w'\n   - 16 cycles of 'ror' (since 16 / 3 = 5 full cycles with a remainder of 1, meaning 5 cycles of 'ror' and 1 extra 'r')\n\n   Total characters after 'w': 16 (w) + 1 (0) + 5 * 3 (ror) + 1 (extra r) = 16 + 1 + 15 + 1 = 33 characters.\n\n4. **Find the rightmost 'w' and the subsequent digit**: The rightmost 'w' in the sequence is at index 19. The 33rd character (after the 'w') is the first character of the 6th cycle of 'ror' (since 5 full cycles are 15 characters, plus the 1 extra 'r' from the remainder).\n\n   The 6th cycle of 'ror' starts with 'r', followed by 'o', and then 'r'. Therefore, the 33rd character is the 'r' in 'ror'.\n\n   Hence, the output digit is 0 (since 'r' is the second character in the 'ror' sequence).\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
