Iterate through the string:\n   - Character at index 1 is '1', so `index = 1`\n   - Character at index 2 is 'i', so `index = 2`\n   - Character at index 3 is 'r', so `index = 3`\n   - Character at index 4 is 'i', so `index = 4`\n   - Character at index 5 is '0', so `index = 5`\n   - Character at index 6 is 'r', so `index = 6`\n   - Character at index 7 is '1', so `index = 7`\n   - Character at index 8 is 'r', so `index = 8`\n   - Character at index 9 is 'i', so `index = 9`\n   - Character at index 10 is '1', so `index = 10`\n   - Character at index 11 is 'r', so `index = 11`\n   - Character at index 12 is 'i', so `index = 12`\n   - Character at index 13 is '0', so `index = 13`\n   - Character at index 14 is 'r', so `index = 14`\n   - Character at index 15 is '1', so `index = 15`\n3. When 'w' is encountered at index 16, `index = 17` (since we need the digit after the **right most** 'w').\n4. The character at index 17 is 'r'.\n\nThus, the output digit is: <r> \n\n</answer>"}
