Determine the character immediately after this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput string: w1i1i1i1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0w0i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1w0r0i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i1i1r0w1r1r1i1r1i1i1i0i1i0i1r1r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r1i1i1r1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i1r1i0i1r1w1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at position 65 (0-indexed).\n\nTo find the character immediately after this 'w', we need to consider the length of the string and the characters preceding 'w'. The string length is 128.\n\nSince the string is padded with spaces (' ') and the characters before the last 'w' are 'i', '0', 'r', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'w', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1'):\n\n- The characters before the last 'w' are: 'i', '0', 'r', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'w', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1'.\n- The total number of characters before the last 'w' is 37.\n\nSince the string is 128 characters long and the last 'w' is at position 65, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is the 66th character in the string.\n\nLet's count from the beginning of the string to the 66th position:\n\n- Characters: w1i1i1i1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0w0i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1w0r0i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i1i1r0w1r1r1i1r1i1i1i0i1i0i1r1r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r1i1i1r1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i1r1i0i1r1w1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1r\n- Spaces: 20\n- Non-space characters before the last 'w': 37\n\nThe 66th character is the first character of the substring starting from the 37th non-space character and extending to the 64th non-space character.\n\nLet's extract this substring:\n\nSubstring: i0r1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0i1r0\n\nThe first character of this substring is 'i'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer> i </answer>"}

The string is composed of alternating sequences of '0', 'i', 'r', and 'w'. \n\nGiven the pattern:\n- '0' appears every 3 characters.\n- 'i' appears every 2 characters.\n- 'r' appears every 3 characters.\n- 'w' appears every 4 characters.\n\nTo find the exact character at the 81st position, we need to determine the sequence at that position. We can do this by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the sequences ('0', 'i', 'r', 'w'): 3, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.\n\nThe LCM of 3, 2, 3, and 4 is 12. This means every 12 characters, the sequence repeats.\n\nLet's calculate the position within the repeating sequence:\n- 81 mod 12 = 9\n\nThis tells us that the 81st position falls within the 9th cycle of the repeating pattern.\n\nThe pattern repeats every 12 characters as follows:\n```\n'0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1' (first 12 characters)\n```\n\nThe 9th cycle starts with '0'. Therefore, the character at the 81st position is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>A</answer>"}
