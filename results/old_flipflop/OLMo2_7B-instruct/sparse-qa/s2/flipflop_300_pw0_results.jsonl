The sequence starts with 'i' and alternates between '0' and '1' until it reaches 'r'. We need to identify the pattern and determine the character at position 77.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n- After 'w', the sequence starts with 'i'.\n- The sequence alternates between '0' and '1' until it reaches 'r'.\n- The length of each sequence is variable but follows a repeating pattern: 'i', '0', '1', 'r'.\n\nTo find the exact character at position 77, we need to trace back through the sequence:\n\n1. Start from 'r': The sequence before 'r' is 'i1r'.\n   - 'i1' has 3 characters.\n   - 'r' is the 4th character.\n   - Total characters in 'i1r' = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n2. Before 'i1r', the sequence is '1i0r'.\n   - '1i' has 2 characters.\n   - '0' is the 3rd character.\n   - 'r' is the 4th character.\n   - Total characters in '1i0r' = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\n3. Before '1i0r', the sequence is '0i1r'.\n   - '0i' has 2 characters.\n   - '1' is the 3rd character.\n   - 'r' is the 4th character.\n   - Total characters in '0i1r' = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\n4. Before '0i1r', the sequence is '1i0'.\n   - '1i' has 2 characters.\n   - '0' is the 3rd character.\n   - Total characters in '1i0' = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nSince position 77 falls within the '1i0' sequence, the character at position 77 is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Determine the character immediately after this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput string: w0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0w1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1w0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i1i1r0i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i1w1i0i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i0w1i1r1r1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1w1r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i1r1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at position 85.\n\nTo find the character immediately after this 'w', we need to consider the string's structure and the indices of characters. The string is composed of alternating sequences of '0', 'i', '1', and 'r'. We need to ensure we are looking at the correct sequence after the 'w'.\n\nGiven the complexity of the string and the alternating pattern, let's write a Python script to accurately determine the character:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0w1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1w0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i1i1r0i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i1w1i0i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i0w1i1r1r1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1w1r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i1r1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0r\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = len(input_string) - 1\n\n# Determine the character after the rightmost 'w'\nif rightmost_w_index < len(input_string):\n    after_w = input_string[rightmost_w_index]\nelse:\n    after_w = ''\n\n# Output the result\nanswer = \"<answer>\" + str(after_w) + \"</answer>"}

Based on the structure of the string and the provided options (A or B), we can conclude:\n\nThe digit after the rightmost 'w' character is **B**. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
