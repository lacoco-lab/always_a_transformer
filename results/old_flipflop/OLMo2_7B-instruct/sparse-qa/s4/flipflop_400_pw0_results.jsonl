For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If it is 'w', update `last_w_pos` to the current position.\n5. After the loop, `last_w_pos` will hold the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n6. Convert `last_w_pos` to its corresponding digit (since it's a zero-indexed position).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0w0i1w0r0i0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0w0i1i0w0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r\"\n\n# Find the position of the rightmost 'w'\nlast_w_pos = -1\nfor i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n    if input_string[i] == 'w':\n        last_w_pos = i\n        break\n\n# Convert the position to its corresponding digit (0-indexed)\nanswer = '<answer>' + str(last_w_pos) + '</answer>"}
