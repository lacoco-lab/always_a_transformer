Determine the character at the position immediately following the last 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\n- The string is composed of various characters, including 'w', digits, and other letters.\n- We need to count the occurrences of 'w' until we reach the end of the string.\n\nBy manually inspecting the string, we find that the last 'w' appears at the 113th position from the start of the string.\n\nNext, we look at the character directly after the 113th 'w'. This character is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
