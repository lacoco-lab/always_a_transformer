Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the character at the position immediately following the last 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and count the occurrences of 'w':\n\n- The first 'w' is at position 7.\n- The next 'w' is at position 18.\n- The next 'w' is at position 31.\n- The next 'w' is at position 44.\n- The next 'w' is at position 58.\n- The next 'w' is at position 67.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next 'w' after the last one in the provided string is at position 76.\n\nNow, we look at the character directly after position 76. The string is:\n```\nw1r1i0i1i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i0i0r0r0i0i0i1w0i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1r1r1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0w0i0r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1w1i1w1i1i1i1w1i1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0w1i0r1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0r\n```\n\nAt position 76, the character is '0'. Therefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
