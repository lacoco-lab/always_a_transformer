Determine the character at the position immediately after the last 'w'.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of 'w' in the string and find the last one:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i0i1w0i0i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i0w1i0i1i0i1r1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i1w1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0w0w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1w0r0i0i0r0r0i0i0i0w1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1w1i1i0i0i1i0i0w1r1i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0r\"\n\nlast_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n```\n\nThe `rfind` method returns the highest index of the substring (in this case, 'w'), or -1 if it is not found. Let's calculate this:\n\n```python\nlast_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n```\n\nAssuming `last_w_index` is calculated correctly, the next step is to get the character at this index + 1 (since indexing in Python starts from 0):\n\n```python\nif last_w_index != -1:\n    next_character = input_string[last_w_index + 1]\nelse:\n    next_character = 'N/A'  # or any placeholder for not found\n\n# Output the result\nanswer = \"<answer>\" + str(next_character) + \"</answer>"}
