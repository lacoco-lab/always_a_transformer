Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' in the input string.\n2. Determine the digit immediately after this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Find the rightmost 'w':**\n   - Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning.\n   - Check each character to see if it is 'w'.\n   - The first 'w' encountered from the end is the rightmost 'w'.\n\n2. **Determine the digit after the rightmost 'w':**\n   - Once the rightmost 'w' is found, count the number of characters from this 'w' to the end of the string.\n   - The index of the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is this count plus the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n   - Convert this index to the corresponding digit (0 or 1).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0w0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0w1i0r1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = -1\nfor i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n    if input_string[i] == 'w':\n        rightmost_w_index = i\n        break\n\n# Determine the digit after the rightmost 'w'\ndigit_after_w = str(rightmost_w_index + 1)  # +1 to get the actual character index\n\n# Convert index to digit (0 or 1)\ndigit = int(digit_after_w[0])\n\n# Output the result\noutput = \"<answer>\" + digit + \"</answer>"}
