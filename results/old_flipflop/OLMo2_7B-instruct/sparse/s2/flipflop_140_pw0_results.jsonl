When 'w' is encountered, determine the position relative to the last 'w' by subtracting `count` from the current `index`.\n6. If the calculated position is within the bounds of the string, print the character at that position.\n7. Reset `index` to the position after the last 'w' to continue searching from the right.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    index = len(input_string) - 1  # Start from the rightmost character\n    count = 0  # Initialize the count of 'w'\n\n    for char in reversed(input_string):  # Iterate from right to left\n        if char == 'w':\n            count += 1\n        if count > 0 and char == 'w':  # Check if we've encountered 'w' before\n            position = index - count  # Calculate the position relative to the last 'w'\n            if 0 <= position < len(input_string):  # Ensure the position is valid\n                print(input_string[position])  # Print the character at the calculated position\n                index -= count  # Move the index forward by the count of 'w'\n                count = 0  # Reset the count for the next 'w'\n\ninput_string = \"w1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1r1i0i0w1r1i1w0i1r0i0i1i1r0w0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0w0i1w0r0r0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1w0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0r\"\nfind_digit_after_w(input_string)\n```\n\nRunning the above code will give us the digit after the last 'w' in the string.

Increment the counter each time we encounter a 'w'.\n4. When the counter equals 'w', print the digit at the current position.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i0i0i0i0w0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i1i1w1i0i0i0i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i1i0i0i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i1w0i0r\"\n\n# Initialize counter\ncounter = 0\n\n# Iterate through the string from right to left\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        counter += 1\n    # When counter equals 'w', print the digit at the current position\n    if counter == len('w'):\n        print(<answer>)\n        counter = 0  # Reset counter for the next iteration\n\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the output digit.
