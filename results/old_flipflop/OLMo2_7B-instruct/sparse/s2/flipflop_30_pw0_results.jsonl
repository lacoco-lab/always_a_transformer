The total number of characters from the rightmost 'w' to the end of the string is 21 (from position 16 to position 36).\n\nNow, we need to find the 21st digit from the rightmost 'w'. We can do this by iterating from the 16th position to the 36th position and accessing each character's Unicode value. The Unicode value of '0' is 48, and '1' is 49. We'll count these values until we reach the 21st occurrence.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1w1i1r\"\nrightmost_w_position = len(input_string) - 1  # Position of the rightmost 'w'\ncount_from_w = rightmost_w_position + 20  # Starting from the 16th position to the 36th position (21st character)\n\n# Initialize a counter for the digit '1'\ncount_ones = 0\n\n# Iterate through the characters from the rightmost 'w' to the end\nfor i in range(count_from_w):\n    char = input_string[i]\n    if char == '1':\n        count_ones += 1\n\n# The 21st digit from the rightmost 'w' is the (count_ones + 1)th character\noutput_digit = chr(count_ones + 1)  # Convert the index to the corresponding character\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
