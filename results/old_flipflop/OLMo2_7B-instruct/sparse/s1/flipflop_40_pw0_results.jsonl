The current character is '1', so move to the next character: `w1`\n5. The current character is 'w', so increment `index`: `index = 3`\n6. The next character is '1', so print the digit at `index` position: `1`\n\nThus, the output digit is `<1>` and </answer>", "flipflop": "w1i1i0i0i1r1i0i0i0i1w1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1r1", "last_valid_token": 1, "last_write_index": 20, "full_answer": "To solve this task algorithmically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.
