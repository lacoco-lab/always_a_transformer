Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of 'w' characters encountered.\n2. Iterate through the input string character by character.\n3. Increment the counter each time a 'w' is encountered.\n4. When the counter reaches 'w' (the specified number of 'w' characters), find the position of the current character in the string.\n5. Return the digit at this position.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string, w):\n    counter = 0\n    position = 0\n    \n    for char in input_string:\n        if char == 'w':\n            counter += 1\n        if counter == w:\n            return str(input_string[position])\n        position += 1\n\n# Given input\ninput_string = \"w0i1w0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i1r0i0i0w0i0i0r0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1r0i1i0i0i1w1i0i1r1i1i1i0w1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1r1i1i1i0i1i0i1w1i1w1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0w1i1i0r1r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i1w1i0i1r1i0i0w0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1w0w0r\"\n    \nw = 3  # Number of 'w' characters to consider\n\n# Execute the function\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string, w)\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(output_digit) + \"</answer>"}
