Iterate through the string starting from the end (rightmost character) until the current character is not 'w'.\n4. Increment `count` each time we encounter 'w'.\n5. Once we reach the end of the string without finding another 'w', the `count` will give us the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n6. Print the digit at the position `count`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1r\"\nright_most_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Ensure the right_most_w_index is within the bounds of the string\nif right_most_w_index != -1:\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(right_most_w_index, -1, -1):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            count += 1\n    # The digit at the rightmost 'w' position\n    output_digit = str(right_most_w_index + 1)  # +1 to convert 0-based index to 1-based\nelse:\n    output_digit = \"No 'w' found\"\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
