Increment the counter each time we encounter a 'w'.\n4. When the counter equals 'w', print the digit at the current position (which is the character immediately to the left of 'w').\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0i1i0w1i0i1i1r1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1w0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1w0i1i0i1r0i1i0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r\"\n\n# Initialize counter\ncounter = 0\n\n# Iterate from the end of the string to the beginning\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        counter += 1\n    # When counter equals 'w', print the character to the left of 'w'\n    if counter == len(input_string) - 1 - 'w'.index(char):\n        print(\"<answer>\" + input_string[counter] + \"</answer>"}
