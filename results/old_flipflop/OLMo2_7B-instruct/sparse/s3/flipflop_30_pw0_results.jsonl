Return the character at the `index` position in the string.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\nInput: w1i0i1w1r1i1i0r1i1i0i1w0i1i1r\n\nFollowing the steps:\n\n1. Initialize `index` to 0.\n2. Start iterating from the second character ('i0').\n\n   - Current character: '0', `index` remains 0.\n   - Current character: 'i', `index` remains 0.\n   - Current character: '1', `index` remains 0.\n   - Current character: 'w', increment `index` to 1.\n   - Current character: '1', `index` remains 1.\n   - Current character: 'r', `index` remains 1.\n   - Current character: 'i', `index` remains 1.\n   - Current character: '1', `index` remains 1.\n   - Current character: 'i', `index` remains 1.\n   - Current character: '0', `index` remains 1.\n   - Current character: 'r', `index` remains 1.\n   - Current character: 'i', `index` remains 1.\n   - Current character: '1', `index` remains 1.\n   - Current character: 'w', increment `index` to 2.\n   - Current character: '0', `index` is now 2.\n   - Current character: 'i', `index` remains 2.\n   - Current character: '1', `index` remains 2.\n   - Current character: 'w', increment `index` to 3.\n   - Current character: '0', `index` is now 3.\n   - Current character: 'i', `index` remains 3.\n   - Current character: '1', `index` remains 3.\n   - Current character: 'i', `index` remains 3.\n   - Current character: '1', `index` remains 3.\n   - Current character: 'r', `index` remains 3.\n   - Current character: 'i', `index` remains 3.\n   - Current character: '1', `index` remains 3.\n   - Current character: 'w', increment `index` to 4.\n   - Current character: '0', `index` is now 4.\n   - Current character: 'i', `index` remains 4.\n   - Current character: '1', `index` remains 4.\n   - Current character: '1', `index` remains 4.\n   - Current character: 'r', `index` remains 4.\n   - Current character: 'i', `index` remains 4.\n\nSince the loop ends here and the current character is 'i', which is not 'w', the `index` is still 4.\n\nFinally, we return the character at index 4 in the string:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If the current character is not 'w', check if `index` is equal to `w`. If it is, return the digit at the current position in the string.\n5.
