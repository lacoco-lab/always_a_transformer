The last character before it is 'i'. To find the digit after the 'i', we need to count the number of characters between the 'i' and 'w'. There are 3 characters between them, so we need to look at the character at the fourth position from the 'i'. The character at the fourth position from 'i' is '0'. Therefore, the digit after the last 'w' character is '0'."}

To extract the digit after the 'w' character, we need to extract the seventh character from the sixth 'w' character. The seventh character from the sixth 'w' character is 'r', and the digit in the seventh position of 'r' is '1'. So, the output digit is '1'.
