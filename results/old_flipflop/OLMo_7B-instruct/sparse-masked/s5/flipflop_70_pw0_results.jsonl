Replace the extracted digit with the <masked_digit> tag:\n```\nMasked sequence: <sequence_start>w1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0w0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i0w1i1i0i1r1i0r<masked_digit>1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i0w1<masked_digit>i1i0i1r1i0r\n```\n\nSo, the masked sequence is:\n```\n<sequence_start>w1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0w0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i0w1i1i0i1r1i0r<masked_digit>1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i0w1<masked_digit>i1i0i1r1i0r\n```<sequence_end>"}
