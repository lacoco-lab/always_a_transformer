Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find 'w' in \"...r1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r\". The rightmost 'w' is actually a bit further back in the string: \"...i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i0w1r1w1r1...\". However, looking closely, there's another 'w' even further to the right: \"...r1w1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i0w1r1w1r1...\". This 'w' is indeed the rightmost one.\n\nNow, we look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'. The string immediately after the rightmost 'w' is \"...r1w1i...\". Therefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
