However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually not followed by any digits because it's at the end of the string. The task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', but since the rightmost 'w' is at the end, there's no digit to report based on the task's criteria.\n\nHowever, upon re-examining the task for clarity and following the instructions precisely as given, the correct approach is to identify the last occurrence of 'w' and then look for the digit immediately following it. If 'w' is the last character, the task as described does not provide a digit to report. \n\nGiven the string ends with \"...i1r0r0i1i1i0i1r\", the last 'w' before this sequence is not immediately followed by a '0' or '1' in a way that the task's conditions are directly applicable due to the oversight in the initial analysis. The correct step should involve identifying the last 'w' and then checking the immediate next character. \n\nUpon a detailed review, the actual last 'w' that is followed by a character is indeed part of the sequence \"...w0i1i1i0i1r...\", indicating the last 'w' followed by a digit is '0'. \n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

However, looking closely, there are multiple 'w's near the end. The actual last 'w' is not followed by any digit directly after it because it's at the end of the string. But if we look at the second to last 'w', it's also not directly followed by a digit. The task, however, asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Since the very last character is 'w' and there's no character after it, we should consider the 'w' before the last 'w' and see if it's followed by a digit.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the string \"...i1i1w1i1w1r1...\" indicates that the second to last 'w' is followed by '1'. However, the instruction was to find the digit after the **rightmost** 'w'. Given the string ends with \"...i0i1i0i0w0r0i1i1i0i0i0i0w0i0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r0r0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0r\", the rightmost 'w' is indeed 'w0' at the end, and the digit after this 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually not followed by any digit since it's at the end of the string. The task requires us to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', but in this case, there isn't one because the string ends right after the 'w'. \n\nHowever, upon re-examining the task, it seems the instruction is to find the digit immediately after the last occurrence of 'w' in the string. Given the string ends with '...i0r0i0r', the last 'w' before this ending sequence is actually 'w0' which is followed by 'i'. But looking at the sequence closely, the actual last 'w' that is followed by a digit is indeed 'w0' at the end of the string '...w0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w0...'. The digit right after this 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

However, looking closely, the last 'w' is not immediately followed by a digit because it's at the end of the string. We need to find the second to last 'w' and see if it's followed by a digit.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the string \"...i1i1r\" ends the sequence before the last 'w', indicating the last 'w' is indeed the rightmost and there are no digits after it. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Since the last 'w' is at the end of the string and there's no digit after it, we should look for the next 'w' to the left that is followed by a digit.\n\nLooking to the left, we find \"...w1...\" which indicates a 'w' followed by a '1'. This 'w' is the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
