However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually not followed by any digit since it's at the end. Let's correct the approach by finding the last 'w' that is followed by a digit.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, we notice that the last 'w' followed by a digit is actually \"w0\" which appears several times. The very last occurrence of 'w' followed by a character is indeed at the end, but since there's no character after the last 'w', we look for the second to last 'w' that is followed by a digit.\n\nThe correct sequence to look for is the last occurrence of \"w\" that is not at the end of the string but is followed by a digit. Given the complexity and the fact that the explanation initially overlooked the presence of 'w' at the end without a following digit, the key insight is to find the last 'w' that has a digit immediately after it.\n\nGiven the string ends with \"r0r\", the last 'w' before this, which is followed by a digit, is crucial. The correct approach involves scanning the string from right to left to find the first 'w' that is followed by a digit.\n\nUpon scanning from right to left, we find that the last 'w' followed by a digit is indeed part of the sequence \"w0\". Therefore, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is \"0\".\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
