The character after this 'w' is '1' but we need to check if there's a 'w' after this 'w' and before the end of the string. There isn't, so the 'w' before the last 'r' is indeed the rightmost 'w'. However, upon closer inspection, there's actually another 'w' before the last series of 'i's and 'r's that is indeed closer to the end of the string than the previously considered 'w'. The correct rightmost 'w' is actually followed by a '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
