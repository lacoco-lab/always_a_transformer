Find the rightmost 'w':\n   - Starting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning, we find the first occurrence of 'w', which is the rightmost 'w'.\n\n2. The string with positions marked for clarity (assuming the first character is at position 1 for simplicity):\n   - w(1)1(2)i(3)0(4)r(5)1(6)i(7)1(8)i(9)0(10)i(11)0(12)i(13)0(14)i(15)0(16)i(17)0(18)i(19)1(20)i(21)1(22)i(23)0(24)i(25)0(26)i(27)1(28)i(29)0(30)i(31)0(32)r(33)1(34)i(35)1(36)i(37)0(38)i(39)0(40)i(41)1(42)i(43)1(44)i(45)1(46)i(47)1(48)i(49)0(50)i(51)0(52)i(53)0(54)i(55)0(56)i(57)0(58)r\n\n3. The rightmost 'w' is at position 1. However, upon re-examining the task, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis since the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', implying there could be multiple 'w's. Let's correct the approach by actually finding the rightmost 'w':\n\nUpon closer inspection, there are indeed multiple 'w's in the string, but they are not immediately apparent due to the nature of the string. The correct approach involves systematically checking the string from right to left for 'w's. \n\nGiven the string does not visually present multiple 'w's upon a casual glance, and considering the nature of the task, let's properly identify the rightmost 'w' and the digit following it:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' in the given string is actually at the beginning, and there are no other 'w's besides the ones at positions that are not immediately visible in a quick scan. The string provided does not contain multiple 'w's that are easily noticeable. \n\nThus, considering the string starts with 'w' and there's no other 'w' to the right of it, the digit immediately after the 'w' at the start of the string is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

The last 'w' in the string is found at the position before \"0i0r0i1w0\" - no, the last 'w' is actually in \"w0i0r0i1w0\", the very last 'w' is the one right before \"0i0r0i1\".\n\nSo, the correct sequence is: \"...i1w0i0r0i1i0r\", here 'w' is followed by '0'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
