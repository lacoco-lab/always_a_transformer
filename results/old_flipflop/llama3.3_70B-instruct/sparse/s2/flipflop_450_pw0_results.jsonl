There is no character to the right of the last 'w' in this case, as it is at the very end of the string. However, upon closer inspection of the provided string, it seems there was an oversight in the initial analysis. The correct approach should involve systematically checking from the end of the string for 'w' and then identifying the digit that follows it. \n\nGiven the string ends with \"...i0r0r0i0r0r\", and there's no 'w' immediately before this sequence that has a digit following it, we need to correctly identify the last 'w' that has a digit after it. \n\nUpon re-examining the string, we notice that the description provided initially might have led to confusion regarding the exact position of the last 'w' with a digit following it. The task requires finding the last occurrence of 'w' that is directly followed by a digit. \n\nGiven the complexity and the potential for error in manual inspection, let's clarify the process with a step-by-step approach that would be used in an algorithmic solution:\n\n1. Start from the end of the string.\n2. Search for the character 'w'.\n3. Once 'w' is found, check the character immediately to its right.\n4. If the character to the right of 'w' is a digit (0 or 1), this digit is the answer.\n\nGiven the string and applying the above steps correctly, we find that the last 'w' that has a digit immediately following it is actually actually followed by '1' in one of its occurrences from the right. \n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is '0' or '1', that is our answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nInput: w1i0r1i0i0i1i1i1w1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1w1i0i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1w0i0i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0r0i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0w1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i0i0i0i0w1i0r1i1i1w0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0w0i1r0i1i0i0w1i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i0i0r0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, and it is followed by no characters because it is the last character. However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually not followed by any digits since it's at the end. Let's correct the approach by finding the last 'w' that is followed by a digit.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, we notice the last 'w' that is followed by a character is actually \"w0\" near the end of the string.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
