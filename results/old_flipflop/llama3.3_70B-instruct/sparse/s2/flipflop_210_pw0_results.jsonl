Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find 'w's in the following positions (counting from the end):\n- The last 'w' is part of \"w0r0r\".\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is in \"w0r0r\". The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
