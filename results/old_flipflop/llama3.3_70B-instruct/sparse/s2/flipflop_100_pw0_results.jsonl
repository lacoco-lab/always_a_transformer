The string is scanned from right to left to find the rightmost 'w'.\n2. The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string \"...w1i1i1i1i0r\", so the 'w' in question is the last 'w' before the '1'.\n3. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
