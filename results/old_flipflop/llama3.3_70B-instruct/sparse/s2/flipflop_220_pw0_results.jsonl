Find the rightmost 'w': Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, the first 'w' encountered is the rightmost one.\n2.

However, upon closer inspection and correcting the step to properly identify the rightmost 'w', we should actually look for the last occurrence of 'w' by scanning the string from right to left. The correct sequence to find the rightmost 'w' involves checking each 'w' from the end of the string towards the beginning. The last 'w' before the end of the string is indeed what we're looking for.\n4. Upon re-examining the string from right to left, the correct rightmost 'w' is found before \"...0i1w0...\". This means the correct 'w' to look at is actually the one right before \"0i1w0\" is not correct based on the initial description. The accurate method involves finding the last 'w' and then looking at the character that follows it. Given the complexity and the need for precision in locating the exact 'w', let's simplify:\n   - The correct approach is to start from the end of the string and find the first 'w' encountered. This 'w' is the rightmost one. Then, look at the character immediately following this 'w'.\n\nGiven the string and the task, the rightmost 'w' is actually actually near the end, and upon a detailed review, the correct sequence to consider for the rightmost 'w' and the digit following it needs to be accurately identified by scanning the string properly.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
