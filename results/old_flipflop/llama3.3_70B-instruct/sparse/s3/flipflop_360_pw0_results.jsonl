The string ends with \"...i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0r1i1i1r\", and moving backwards, we find 'w' in \"...w0i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1w1...\". The rightmost 'w' is actually in \"...i0w0i1i1i1r0...\". However, looking closely, there's another 'w' even further to the right, which is part of \"...i1i0i1i0w0...\". This 'w' is indeed the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n\nSo, the character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
