The string ends with \"...0i1i0i0r\", so we look for 'w' in the part before this. \n   - Upon searching, we find that the rightmost 'w' is actually in the sequence \"...r0i0i1i0i0r\" which is not correct since 'w' is not there, my mistake. Let me recheck the string from the end to find the last 'w'.\n\nUpon re-examining the string from right to left:\n- \"...r0i0i1i0i0r\" does not contain 'w'.\n- Continuing the search backwards, we find 'w' in \"...i0i1r0i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i0r\".\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is actually in the part of the string that reads \"...i0i1r0i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i0r\" which still seems incorrect because I made another mistake in identifying the position. The correct approach should involve a systematic search from the end of the string towards the beginning to accurately locate the last 'w'.\n\nCorrect Approach:\n- The string is \"w0i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i0r\".\n- Searching from the end, the last 'w' is found to be before \"...0i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i0r\", which means my previous steps to locate it were incorrect.\n\nLet's accurately find the last 'w' now:\nThe correct sequence to look for the last 'w' should start from the end of the string. Given the mistakes in manual searching, the right approach involves checking each character from the end towards the start until we find 'w'. \n\nGiven the errors in manual location, let's simplify:\nThe last 'w' in the string \"w0i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i0r\" is actually at the beginning because there are no other 'w's after the first one except for those that might appear later, which they don't in this explanation. My mistake was in assuming and not properly checking the string for 'w' occurrences beyond the first one.\n\nCorrectly now, without assuming:\n- The string starts with \"w\", and there are no other 'w's mentioned in the search towards the end, meaning the rightmost 'w' is indeed the first character \"w\" since no other 'w's are found later in the string.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is the digit immediately following the first 'w', which is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
