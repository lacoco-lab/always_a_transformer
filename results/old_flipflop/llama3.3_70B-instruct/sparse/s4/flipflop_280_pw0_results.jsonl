However, following the instruction to the letter as requested, and given that the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w' and the provided string does not directly offer a digit after the last 'w' but rather a sequence of characters, the misunderstanding may arise from the interpretation of the task. Given the strict format requirement but acknowledging the potential for confusion in the task description, the response should technically identify the first digit encountered after the rightmost 'w', which in the sequence provided, would indeed be \"1\" as it follows the 'i' that directly follows the 'w'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

The string ends with \"...i1i1i1i1i0r\", so moving backwards, we find 'w' in \"...w0i0i1i0i1i0i1w0...\" which is not the rightmost, and then further back \"...i0i0w0...\" which still is not it. Continuing the search, we find the rightmost 'w' is actually in \"...i0w0...\" near the end.\n3. The character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
