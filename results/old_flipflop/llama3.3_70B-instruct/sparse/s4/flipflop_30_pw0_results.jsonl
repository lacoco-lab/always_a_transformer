Finding the last occurrence of 'w':\n   - The string starts with 'w', then there's another 'w' in the middle, and the last 'w' is near the end: \"...i1i1w0r\"\n   - So, the last 'w' is at the position right before \"0r\".\n\n2. Checking the character to the right of the last 'w':\n   - The character immediately to the right of the last 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
