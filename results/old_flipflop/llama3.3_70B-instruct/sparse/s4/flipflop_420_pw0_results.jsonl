However, the task is to find the digit after the rightmost 'w'. \n\nUpon closer inspection, the string ends with \"...i0i1i0r\", and before that, there's a 'w' followed by '1', which is \"w1i0i0i0i1i0r1r1i0w1i0i1w1i1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i1i0i0i1w1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1w0...\". The rightmost 'w' before the ending sequence is actually \"w1\" and it's followed by '1'. \n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
