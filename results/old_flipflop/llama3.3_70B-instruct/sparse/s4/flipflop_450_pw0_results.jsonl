Find the rightmost 'w': The string ends with \"...i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r\", and the last 'w' before this part is actually \"w1\" which appears before the sequence \"...r1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0r1w0...\". The very last 'w' is in \"w0\" and then followed by \"i1r0...\". So, the rightmost 'w' is in \"w0\" and it's followed by \"i1\".\n\n2. The digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1' because 'w' is followed by '0i1', and the digit we are looking for is the '0' in 'w0', not the '1'. My analysis initially misidentified the sequence; correctly, after the last 'w', which is 'w0', the digit is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
