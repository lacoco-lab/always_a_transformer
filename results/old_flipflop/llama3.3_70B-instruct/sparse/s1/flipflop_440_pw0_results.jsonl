If that character is a digit (0 or 1), that's our answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nInput: w1r1i1i0i1i1w0r0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i1w1i1w1i1i1i0r1i1w0r0i1i0i1w0i1i0i0i0i0w0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r1w0w0i0i0r0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0w0i1r0r0r0w0i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i1r0i1w1r1i0i0i1i0i1i0w1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1w0r0i1i1i0i1r0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r\n\nStarting from the right end of the string and moving left, we find the rightmost 'w' and then look at the character immediately to its right.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in the sequence \"...i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r\" which is not correct as there's no 'w' here. Let's correct the approach by actually finding the last 'w' in the string.\n\nUpon re-examining the string from right to left, we find the last occurrence of 'w' is actually in \"...i1w0w0i0i0r0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0w0i1r0r0r0w0...\". The correct last 'w' is the one right before \"...i0i0r0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0w0...\". \n\nSo, the correct sequence with the last 'w' is \"...w0i1r0r0r0w0i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0w0...\". Here, the 'w' in question is followed by \"0\".\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

However, the task is to find the digit after the **rightmost** 'w'. \n\nGiven the string ends with \"...i0i0r\", and the last 'w' before this ending is part of \"...w1w1w1...\", the rightmost 'w' that has a digit after it is indeed one of the 'w's in \"...w1w1w1...\". But since we are looking for the very last 'w' and its immediate following digit, and considering the structure of the task, it seems the focus should be on the last occurrence of 'w' followed by a digit without considering if there are 'w's after it without a following digit.\n\nThus, focusing on \"...w1w1w1...\", the digit after the rightmost 'w' in this sequence is '1'. However, considering the entire string and the instruction to find the digit after the **rightmost** 'w', and realizing the explanation might have led to a confusion by not directly identifying the last 'w' followed by a digit correctly in the context of the whole string, let's clarify:\n\nThe task requires identifying the last 'w' in the string that is followed by a digit. Given the structure of the input and the goal, the correct approach is to scan the string from right to left and stop at the first 'w' that is immediately followed by a digit. \n\nGiven this correction and focusing on the actual task of finding the digit after the rightmost 'w', we should directly look for the last 'w' that has a '1' or '0' immediately after it, without getting confused by the presence of multiple 'w's at the end.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
