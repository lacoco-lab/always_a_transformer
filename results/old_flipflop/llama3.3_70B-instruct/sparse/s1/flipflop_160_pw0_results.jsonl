Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find 'w' at several positions, but the rightmost one is towards the end: ...i0w1i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i1r. The rightmost 'w' is in \"...i0w...\".\n\nNow, we look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w', which is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string \"...w0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0r\". So, the 'w' in question is the one right before \"...0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0r\".\n2. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
