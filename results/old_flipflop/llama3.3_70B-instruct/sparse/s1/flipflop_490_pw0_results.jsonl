The actual last 'w' that is followed by a character is \"w1\" which appears several times in the string, but focusing on the last part where 'w' appears, we see \"w0\" and \"w1\" patterns. The very last 'w' that has a digit after it is indeed \"w1\".\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually part of a sequence \"i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r\" which ends the string, meaning the last 'w' is not immediately followed by a digit in the conventional sense since it's at the end. But, upon closer inspection, the actual last 'w' that is followed by a character is \"w1\" in \"i1i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i0i1i0w0\" is not the last 'w', the sequence \"w0\" appears later, and the very last 'w' is indeed not followed by any digit as it's at the end of the string. The correct sequence to look at is the last 'w' that has a character after it, which is \"w1\" in a sequence that appears before the end of the string.\n\nGiven the correct understanding of the task, the last 'w' that is followed by a digit is indeed \"w1\". \n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

Let's correct the approach by finding the last 'w' that is followed by a character.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, the last 'w' that is followed by a character is actually \"w1\" near the end. The character immediately after this 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

The 'w' in question is the last character before this sequence, but since there are multiple 'w's, we need to ensure we've found the very last one. Upon closer inspection, the sequence \"...w1w1w1i1i1i1i1i1r1i0r1w0...\" indicates that the last 'w' before the sequence \"...i1i0r\" is indeed part of a series of 'w's but the very last 'w' before any digits or other characters that are not 'w' is what we're interested in. \n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precision in identifying the exact position of the rightmost 'w' followed by a digit, let's simplify the approach by directly examining the string from right to left for the last occurrence of 'w' that is immediately followed by a digit.\n\nUpon a detailed examination from right to left, we find that the sequence ends with \"...i1i0r\", and working backwards, the last 'w' that is immediately followed by a digit is part of the sequence that ends the string. The correct approach involves systematically checking each 'w' from the right until we find one that is directly followed by a digit.\n\nGiven the string's complexity and the manual nature of this examination, the focus should be on the last few characters and sequences that contain 'w' followed by digits. \n\nThe last 'w' followed by a digit in the sequence provided, upon careful manual inspection or a systematic check from the right, is found to be 'w1' in the sequence that appears towards the end of the string. This indicates the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
