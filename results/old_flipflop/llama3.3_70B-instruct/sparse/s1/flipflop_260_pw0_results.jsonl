Print the character immediately after this 'w' character.\n\nLet's apply this process to the given string:\n\nInput: w0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i1i0i0i0r0i0i1i0w1i0r1w1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1w0i1i1w0i0r0i1i0r0i0i1i0w0r0i1i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1w1r1i1i1i1w0i1i1i1r0r0i0r0i0i0i0w0i1i0w0i0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0r0i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i0w1i0r1i1i0r\n\nStarting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning, we find the first 'w' character. The string ends with \"...i1i0r\", so we move backwards. The last 'w' is in \"...w1i0r...\". The character immediately after this 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
