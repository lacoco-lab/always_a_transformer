The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string: \"...i0i0i0r\" is the part before the last 'w', so the string after the last 'w' is not present as 'w' is the last character. However, upon re-examining the string, the actual last 'w' is followed by \"0i0i0r0i0r0r0i0i0i1w\" is not correct since 'w' appears again, the correct last 'w' is actually \"w0\" at the very end of the string \"...i1i1i0r1i0i0i0r\" is before the last 'w'. The correct sequence is \"...i0i0i0r0i0r0r0i0i0i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i0i0i0r\" and the last 'w' is in \"w0\" which means the digit after the last 'w' is \"0\".\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
