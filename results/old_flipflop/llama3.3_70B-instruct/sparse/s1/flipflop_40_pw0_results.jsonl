The string is scanned from right to left to find the rightmost 'w'. \n   - Starting from the right, we find 'w' at several positions, but we are interested in the last one when scanning from left to right, which is the rightmost 'w' when considering the string's natural order.\n\n2. Upon scanning the string from right to left, the rightmost 'w' is found in the sequence \"...i0w0i0r0i0i0w0i0r0w0r0i1i1r0w0i0i1i1r...\". The actual rightmost 'w' in the entire string is the one just before \"...0i0r0i0i0w0...\". So, the rightmost 'w' is in \"...i0w...\".\n\n3. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

The rightmost 'w' is found in the sequence \"...r0i1i1r\" which is \"...w\" is not present, my mistake, let me recheck the string from right to left: \"...r0i1i1r...\". Upon re-examining, the last 'w' is actually in the sequence \"...i0i0i0r0i1i1r\" which still doesn't contain a 'w', my mistake again. Let me properly scan it: The correct sequence from right to left is \"...i1i1r\" then \"...0i1i0...\" and so on until we find the 'w'. The 'w' is actually at the start of the string \"w0...\". However, there's another 'w' in \"...r0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0r0i1i0i0i0r0i1i1r\" which is not true, the 'w' is indeed at the beginning and there's another 'w' in \"...i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0r0...\" which is also not true. The correct 'w' from the right is actually in the sequence \"...i0i0i0r0i1i1r\" which is incorrect, I made another mistake.
