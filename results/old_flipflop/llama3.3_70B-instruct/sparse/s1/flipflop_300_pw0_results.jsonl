Find the rightmost 'w': Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, the first 'w' encountered is the rightmost one.\n2. The string ends with \"...r0r\", and moving backwards, we find 'w's at various positions, but the last one before the end is what we're interested in.\n3. Upon inspecting the string closely, the rightmost 'w' is found within the sequence \"...i1i0w0r0i0i1i0i1i1w0i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1r0r\". However, this is not the correct sequence to look at for the rightmost 'w'. Continuing the search backwards, we actually find the rightmost 'w' in \"...i0w0r0i0i1i0i1i1...\". Yet, this description still doesn't accurately represent the process of finding the rightmost 'w'. The correct approach involves systematically searching from the end of the string towards the beginning until the last 'w' is found.\n4. Correctly identifying the rightmost 'w' requires a meticulous search from the end of the string. The actual rightmost 'w' is located in a position that is closer to the end of the string than my initial descriptions suggested. To accurately find it, one must start from the end of the string and move backwards until the character 'w' is encountered. Given the complexity and the need for precision, let's simplify: The task is to find the last occurrence of 'w' and then look at the next character.\n\nGiven the string's complexity and my initial misdirection, let's directly address the task:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is actually actually near the end, and upon a detailed review, the correct sequence to consider for the rightmost 'w' and the digit immediately after it needs to be identified by a thorough search from the string's end.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Specifically, the rightmost 'w' is the one in \"...w1...\".\n3. Look at the character immediately following the rightmost 'w': After 'w1', the next character is 'i', but since we are looking for a digit (0 or 1), and 'i' is not a digit, we continue. However, my initial approach to directly solve this was incorrect as I should directly identify the digit following the last 'w'. The correct step is to find the last occurrence of 'w' and then look at the immediate next character which should be either '0' or '1'. Given the correct identification of the last 'w' as 'w1', the digit immediately after it is indeed '0' or '1', but since 'w1' itself indicates the digit '1' is after the 'w', the correct answer should directly relate to the digit associated with the last 'w'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
