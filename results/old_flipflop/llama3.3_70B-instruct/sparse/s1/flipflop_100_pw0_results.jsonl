The string ends with \"...i1i1i1r0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0r\", and the last 'w' is before \"...0i1i1i1r0r0...\". Specifically, the sequence is \"...w0i1i1i1r0r0...\".\n\nSo, the character immediately to the right of the last 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is a digit (0 or 1), print it.\n\nGiven Input: w0i1w0w0i0i0r0w0i0i1i1i0r0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0w1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i0i0i0i1r\n\nLet's perform the task:\n\n1. The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string: \"...i0i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i0i0i0i1r\" - there's no 'w' here, we look earlier: \"...w1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i0i0i0i1r\". The 'w' before \"1i0...\" is the rightmost 'w'.\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
