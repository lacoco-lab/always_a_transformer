The rightmost 'w' is found at the very end of the string, which is part of \"w1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r\". So, the 'w' in question is the one right before \"1i1i1i1i0...\".\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
