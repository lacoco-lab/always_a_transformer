If that character is a digit (0 or 1), that's our answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0r0i1i1i0w0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1w1i0i0i0r1i0r1i1r1i0r1i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0w0i0i0i0i0r0w1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1w1w1i1r1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i0w1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1w0i0i1i0i1i0w0r0i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i1i0i0r1w1w1w1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, and it is followed by no characters because it is the last character. However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually part of a sequence \"r1w1w1w1\" which means the last 'w' is indeed followed by no digit directly after it since it's the last character in the sequence and in the string. But since we need to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', we look at the sequence and see that the rightmost 'w' in \"w1w1w1\" is followed by no digit because it's the last 'w' and there are no more characters after it. \n\nHowever, upon re-examining the task, it seems the goal is to find the digit immediately after the last occurrence of 'w' in the string. Given the string ends with \"...i0i1i0r1w1w1w1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1w0...\", the actual last 'w' is in \"...r1w1w1w1...\". The last 'w' in this sequence is followed by no digit because the task was misunderstood in explanation. The correct approach should directly identify the last 'w' and then look for the digit after it. In \"...r1w1w1w1...\", the last 'w' is indeed 'w1', and '1' is the digit after the 'w'. \n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
