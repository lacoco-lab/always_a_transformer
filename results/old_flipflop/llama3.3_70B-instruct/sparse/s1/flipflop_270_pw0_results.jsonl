The last 'w' before this sequence is the rightmost 'w'.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the sequence around the last 'w' is: ...w0i1i0i1i1i0i0w0r0i0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is actually in the sequence: ...i1i1w1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r... No, this 'w' is not the rightmost. Looking further to the left, we find another 'w' in: ...w0i1i0i1i1i0i0w0... This 'w' is also not the rightmost. The actual rightmost 'w' is in the sequence: ...w1i1i1w1... No, this is not it either. The correct sequence for the rightmost 'w' is: ...i1i1w0i1i0i1i1i0i0w0... The 'w' here is still not the rightmost. The correct rightmost 'w' is in the sequence: ...w1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r... No, this is not the rightmost 'w'. The correct sequence is actually: ...i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r, looking to the left we find: ...w0i1i0i1i1i0i0... This 'w' is not the rightmost. The correct 'w' is in the sequence: ...i1i1i1i0i1i1w0... No, the 'w' here is not the rightmost 'w' in the string. \n\nLooking carefully, the rightmost 'w' is actually in the sequence: ...i1i1i1i0i1i1w0... Yes, this 'w' is the rightmost 'w'. \n\nSo, the character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
