Find the last occurrence of 'write' in the string.\n2. After finding 'write', look at the immediate next character.\n3. Print the digit that comes after 'write'.\n\nGiven Input: write1ignore0ignore0ignore1read\n\n1. The last occurrence of 'write' is at the end of the string: \"...ignore1**write** is not present, but 'write' is present at the beginning. However, since we need the rightmost 'write', we consider the string from the end. The string ends with 'read', and before that, there's 'ignore1'. So, the last 'write' is actually at the start of the string, but we look for the last occurrence from the right, which in this context means we look for 'write' from the end of the string. Since there's no 'write' after 'ignore1', the 'write' at the beginning is the one we consider for the task, given the instruction to find the rightmost 'write'. However, my initial analysis was incorrect in assuming 'write' could be found from the right in a meaningful way that differs from the start. The task implies finding the last 'write' and then looking at what follows it, which in a linear string means starting from the beginning or end and moving towards the other. The correct approach should directly address the instruction without overcomplicating it: find the last 'write' and print the digit after it.\n\n2. The correct last 'write' to consider in the sequence given is indeed the first 'write' since there are no other 'write's.
