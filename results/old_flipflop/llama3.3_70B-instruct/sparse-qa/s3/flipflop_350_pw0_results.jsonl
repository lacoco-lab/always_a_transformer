However, in this case, the last 'w' is indeed the last character of a sequence of 'w's at the end of the string, and there's no character after the last 'w' in the sequence that is not 'w' until the end of the string. \n\nUpon closer inspection, the sequence at the end is \"...w0r0i0r0i0i0r0i0i0r\" which means the last 'w' that is not immediately followed by another 'w' but by a different character is actually \"...i1w0r0...\". Thus, the digit after this 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. The rightmost 'w' in the string is indeed at the end, and there's no digit after it because it's the last character. But, considering the instruction and the provided options, it seems we are to consider the 'w' that has a character after it, which would be the second to last 'w' if we were considering 'w's with following characters. However, strictly following the instruction:\n\nThe last 'w' is followed by no character, but if we consider the intent might be to find the last 'w' with a character after it, we'd look at the second to last 'w' which is not the correct approach based on the literal interpretation of the instruction. The instruction asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w', and since there's no digit after the last 'w' (because it's the last character), the question's premise as interpreted doesn't align with finding a digit after the very last 'w' since there isn't one.\n\nGiven the options and the aim to provide an answer based on the choices given (A or B), and considering a misunderstanding in the interpretation where one might look for the last 'w' that has a digit immediately following it (which would not be the rightmost 'w' but the last 'w' before the end of the string that has a digit after it), let's correct the approach:\n\nThe actual last 'w' does not have a digit after it because it's the last character. If we were to consider the 'w' before the last one that has a digit after it, we'd be looking at a different scenario. But since the question specifically asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w' and given that 'w' is the last character, there's a confusion in the question's interpretation.\n\nTo adhere strictly to the format requested and given the confusion in the interpretation, the correct approach based on the question's wording (digit after the **rightmost** 'w') would not yield a digit since the rightmost 'w' is the last character. However, considering the intent might have been to explore the digit after the last 'w' that has a following character, one would still need to identify such a 'w'. The last 'w' before the end of the string that has characters after it is \"w1\" at the end of the string \"i0r1w1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i1i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1r1i0r1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i0r\" which indeed ends with \"w1\", indicating the digit after this 'w' is \"1\".\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
