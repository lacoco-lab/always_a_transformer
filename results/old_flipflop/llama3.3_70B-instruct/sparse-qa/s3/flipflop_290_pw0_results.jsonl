Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the input string: w0r0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i0w0w0i1r0w0i0r0i1r0i1w1i0r1i0i0i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0r0i1i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i0w0i1i1i1r0r0i0r0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i0w0i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i1i0w1w1i0i0i1i1i0w1w1i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1w1i1i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1r1r\n\nStarting from the end of the string and moving left, we find the first 'w' which is part of \"r1w1i1i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1r1r\". The 'w' in question is the last 'w' in \"i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1r1r\", but since we are looking for the rightmost 'w' and there's another 'w' to its right, we consider \"w1i1i0i0w1\". The rightmost 'w' is actually in \"i1i0i0w1\".\n\nSo, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
