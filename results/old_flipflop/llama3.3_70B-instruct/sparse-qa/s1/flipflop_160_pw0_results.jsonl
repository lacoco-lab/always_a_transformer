The rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in this sequence.\n\nThe sequence \"w0w0\" indicates that after the rightmost 'w', there are no more characters because it's at the very end of the string, but since we're looking for the digit immediately after the 'w' and there's another 'w' before it, we consider the '0' that comes right after the second to last 'w'. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', which means we look at the last 'w' in \"w0w0\". Since there's no digit after the last 'w' (as it ends the string), we must consider the arrangement and see that the question essentially asks for the digit following the 'w' that is furthest to the right, which in the context given, leads to examining the sequence incorrectly due to the phrasing of the task.\n\nCorrecting the approach based on the task's specific wording and the provided options:\n- The rightmost 'w' is indeed the last character in the sequence \"w0w0\".\n- However, the question seems to imply looking for a digit that follows a 'w' in a sequence where such a digit exists to the right of 'w'. Given the structure \"w0w0\" and the fact that we're examining the string from right to left for the 'w' and then looking for what comes after it, the confusion arises from the interpretation.\n\nGiven the string ends with \"w0w0\" and we are to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', and considering the structure of the question, it seems the intent might be misunderstood in the explanation. The rightmost 'w' is followed by nothing since it's the last character, but in the context of finding a digit after a 'w' in the sequence provided, one might incorrectly assume looking for a digit in the sequence \"w0w0\" where '0' follows a 'w', not the rightmost 'w' which is at the end.\n\nThus, clarifying the correct step based on the task:\n- The task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'.\n- The string ends with \"w0w0\", meaning the last 'w' does not have a digit after it in the conventional sense since it's the last character.\n\nHowever, considering the logical approach to the task and the provided options, and acknowledging a mistake in the interpretation:\nThe correct interpretation should focus on the fact that the task implies finding a digit that directly follows a 'w' in the sequence, and given the options and the structure of the task, the logical step is to identify the sequence \"w0w0\" and understand the question might be probing for the understanding of sequence and position.\n\nGiven this, the correct answer, following the intended logic of the task and correcting for the misunderstanding in the explanation, should reflect the option that aligns with the digit found after a 'w' in the sequence provided, acknowledging the error in interpreting the task's requirement.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
