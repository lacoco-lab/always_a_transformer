The correct sequence to look at is the last occurrence of 'w' that is not at the very end of the string and has a digit after it.\n\nLooking closely, \"...w1i...\" is the pattern we're interested in, where 'w' is followed by '1'. This pattern appears multiple times, and it's the last occurrence of 'w' followed by a digit that we're interested in.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need to accurately identify the last 'w' that is followed by a digit, let's simplify:\n\nThe last 'w' that is not alone at the end and is followed by a character is indeed part of the sequence where 'w' is followed by '1', as in \"...w1...\". \n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that has a following character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
