But looking further to the left, we find another 'w', which is the rightmost 'w' in the sequence \"...i0i0w0i1i0i1i0i1i1r0...\". Yet, moving further left, we find \"...w1i1i1i1w1...\". The 'w' in \"w1\" here is not the rightmost since we found another 'w' to its right. However, looking at \"...i0i0w0i1i0i1i0i1i1...\", the 'w' here is also not the rightmost because we have \"...w1i1i1i1w1...\" to its right.
