Let's correct the approach by finding the last 'w' that has a character after it.\n\nUpon reviewing the string again, the last 'w' that has characters after it is actually \"w1\" near the end. The correct sequence to look at is the last occurrence of 'w' that is not at the very end of the string but is followed by a digit.\n\nGiven the string ends with \"...i0i1i1i1i1i0r1i0r\", and before that, we have \"...w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r1i0r\", it indicates the last 'w' followed by a digit is indeed \"w1\".\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that has a following character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
