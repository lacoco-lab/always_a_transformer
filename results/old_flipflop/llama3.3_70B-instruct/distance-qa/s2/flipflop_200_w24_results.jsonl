By inspecting the string from right to left, we find the last 'w' is near the end but not at the very end. The relevant part of the string for our purposes is \"...r0r0i1r0r0r0r\".\n\nHowever, to accurately identify the rightmost 'w' and the digit following it without manually scanning the entire string, which could be prone to error, let's break it down:\n\nThe string provided is quite long, but we can simplify our approach by looking for the last occurrence of 'w' and then checking the next character.\n\nUpon closer inspection and using a systematic approach to find the last 'w', we notice the string ends with \"...r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r\", and working our way backward, we find a 'w' followed by \"0i0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0i1r0r0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0i1i1i0r0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i1i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0r\" before it.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is actually \"w0\" which is followed by \"i0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0i1r0i1w\" is not the rightmost 'w', the correct sequence to look for the rightmost 'w' is from the end of the string towards the beginning until we find 'w', and upon finding it, we look at the next character.\n\nGiven the complexity and the potential for error in manual inspection, the key insight is to identify the last 'w' and then look at the character immediately following it. \n\nIn this case, the last 'w' is indeed followed by a \"0\", as indicated by the sequence \"...w0...\" which appears before the final sequences of 'i's and 'r's and other 'i's and 'r's.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

The string ends with a series of 'r0' repetitions after the last 'w'. The last 'w' is followed by '0', which is the digit we are looking for.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
