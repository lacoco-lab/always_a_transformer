The rightmost 'w' is near the end: ...r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0r is after the second 'w', so the 'w' in question is \"w0\".\n\nThe character immediately after \"w0\" is \"i\", but we are looking for a digit. The question asks for the digit after the 'w', which means we are looking for the next digit after 'w', not necessarily immediately after.

Thus, the correct interpretation should focus on the sequence \"w0\", where '0' is indeed the digit directly after 'w'.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, following the task's apparent intent and the provided options, is:\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
