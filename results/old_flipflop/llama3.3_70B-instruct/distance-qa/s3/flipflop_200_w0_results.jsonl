Since there's only one 'w' in the given string, which is at the beginning, we look at the string from left to right to identify the pattern and find the digit immediately following the 'w' is not what we're looking for. Instead, we need to understand that the task implies finding the last occurrence of 'w' and then looking at the digit that follows it. However, given the 'w' is at the start and there's no 'w' later in the string to be considered as \"rightmost\" in a comparative sense, the question seems to be about understanding the sequence and pattern recognition rather than a complex algorithm.\n\nGiven the 'w' is at the start, the digit immediately after it is '1'.

Since there's only one 'w' in the given string, which is at the beginning, we look at the string from left to right to identify the pattern and find the last occurrence of 'w' is actually the first character. The task, however, asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', which means we are looking for the digit immediately following the 'w' since it's the only 'w' present.\n\nThe string starts with \"w1...\", so the digit immediately after 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
