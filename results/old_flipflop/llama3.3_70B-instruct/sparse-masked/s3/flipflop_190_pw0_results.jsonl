Given the complexity and the need for precision in locating the rightmost 'w' and then masking the following digit, the task requires a detailed step-by-step analysis which might not be fully captured in the initial explanation.\n\nTo clarify, the correct masking should occur at the position right after the last 'w' in the sequence, which upon reevaluation, suggests a need for a precise location identification.
