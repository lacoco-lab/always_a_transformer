Since the 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it. However, according to the task, I should mask the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Given the string ends with 'w0', the '0' is the digit right after the 'w'. \n\nSo, the digit to be masked is '0'. I replace this '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string is:\nw1i0w1i1i1i1i0w1i1i0r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r1r1w0i1w0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0i1w1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0r1i0i0w0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r0w1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i1w0w0r0i0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i1i0r0i0i0i0w<masked_digit>\n\nHere is the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
