Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\nInput string: w1r1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1r1i0w1r1i1i0i0w0i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i0w1i1r1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i1w1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i0w0w0w0i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r\n\nStep 1: Find the rightmost 'w' character.\nThe rightmost 'w' character is at the end of the string: ...i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r (there are four 'w's together at the end, so the rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the sequence w0w0w0).\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\nSince the rightmost 'w' is the last character in the sequence w0w0w0, the digit immediately after it is 'i', but 'i' is not a digit. However, there is no digit immediately after the last 'w'. The task requires masking a digit after 'w', but in this case, there is no digit after the last 'w'. The correct approach is to find the last 'w' that has a digit immediately after it.\n\nRevisiting the string to find the last 'w' that has a digit after it: ...w1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i0w0w0w0...\n\nThe last 'w' with a digit after it is 'w' in 'w0' before the sequence 'w0w0w0'. The digit after this 'w' is '0'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\nReplace '0' with '<masked_digit>' in 'w0' to get 'w<masked_digit>'.\n\nNow, replace 'w0' with 'w<masked_digit>' in the original string.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (that has a digit after it) masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w1r1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1r1i0w1r1i1i0i0w0i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i0w1i1r1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i1w1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i0w<masked_digit>w0w0<masked_digit> is incorrect since we only mask one digit, the correct masking is w<masked_digit> and the rest of the string remains the same: ...i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r \nThe correct masked sequence is: \n<sequence_start>w1r1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1r1i0w1r1i1i0i0w0i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i0w1i1r1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i1w1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i0w<masked_digit>w0w0w0i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r<sequence_end>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\nInput: w1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1w1w1i0r1i1r1w0i0r0i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i1i0i0w1w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i0i0i0w1i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r\n\nStep 1: Find the rightmost 'w' character.\nAfter examining the input string, I found that the rightmost 'w' character is at the position where 'w1' appears for the last time.\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\nReplace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string:\nw1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1w1w1i0r1i1r1w0i0r0i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i1i0i0w1w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i0i0i0w1i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w1i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r\". \nSo the correct masked sequence is: \nw1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1w1w1i0r1i1r1w0i0r0i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i1i0i0w1w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i0i0i0w1i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the position where \"w1\" is. \nSo, w1 should be replaced with w<masked_digit>.\n\nThe final masked sequence is:\nw1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1w1w1i0r1i1r1w0i0r0i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i1i0i0w1w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i0i0i0w1i1i0i1i0w<masked_digit>i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r\n\n<sequence_start>w1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1w1w1i0r1i1r1w0i0r0i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i1i0i0w1w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i0i0i0w1i1i0i1i0w<masked_digit>i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r<sequence_end>"}
