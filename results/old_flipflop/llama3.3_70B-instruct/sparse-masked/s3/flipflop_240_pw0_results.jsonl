However, since there is no digit after the last 'w' (as it is at the end of the string), the task as described does not apply in the conventional sense because there is no digit to mask. \n\nBut to follow the instructions precisely and given the nature of the task, I will still provide the modified string as per the instructions, keeping in mind that the last 'w' does not have a digit after it to mask. Thus, the string remains unchanged in terms of masking a digit after 'w', but I will still output it as instructed:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i0i0i1r1i1i1w0i0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0w0i0i1i0i1w0i0i1w0i0w0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i1w1i1i0i0i1r1i0i0r1r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0w1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r1i1w0r0i1i0i1i0i0w1i1r1i0i1i0i0r1w0r0w1w1i0r1i0i1r<sequence_end>"}

Since the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it. However, I will re-examine the string to ensure I didn't miss any 'w' characters.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, I find another 'w' character: ...i1w1w1r1r1i1i0w0... and then ...0w1w1i0w1i1r1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r. The rightmost 'w' that is not at the end of the string is ...0w1... and the digit after it is '1'.\n\nNow, I replace the identified digit '1' with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' character masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i0i0r0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i0i0w1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i0w0i0r0i0w0i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i1i0w1i1w1w1r1r1i1i0w0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1w0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0w1w1i0w1i1r1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0<masked_digit>i1i1i0r</sequence_end>\n\nHowever, the above solution is incorrect because I need to mask the digit right after the last 'w' in the string \"w1w1w1r1r1i1i0w0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1w0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0w1w1i0w1i1r1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r\". \n\nLet's re-evaluate the string to find the last 'w'. The correct last 'w' is in \"0w1w1i0w1i1r1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r\".
