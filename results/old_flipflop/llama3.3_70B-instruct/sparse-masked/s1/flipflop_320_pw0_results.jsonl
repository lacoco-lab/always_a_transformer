After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0i1r.\n\nNow, I identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character. Since the 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it. However, I will mask the digit before the last 'w' since there's no digit after the last 'w'. The last 'w' is preceded by '0', so I will mask this '0'.\n\nHere is the masked sequence:\n<sequence_start>w1w1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i1i0i0i1i0i0w1i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i0w0i1i1i0w0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1w0r0i1i1i1r0r0w1i0i1i1i0w1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i0i1w1i0i1i1w1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r1w1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1w0i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i1i1i0<masked_digit>w1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1w0i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r<sequence_end>"}

The digit after 'w0' is 'i', not a digit, so we look at the 'w1' before it. The digit after 'w1' is '1', but there is another 'w' after it, so we consider the last 'w1'. The digit after the last 'w1' is indeed '1', but there is no 'w' after it, only 'w0', and we already determined the digit after 'w0' is 'i', not a digit. However, we need to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', which is 'w0', but since 'w0' is followed by 'i', we actually need to look at the 'w1' before the last 'w0' for the purpose of this task as it seems to be a misunderstanding in the explanation. The correct 'w' to consider for masking the digit after it is indeed 'w1' since it's the one that has a digit immediately after it in the sequence provided.\n\nSo, the correct sequence to mask is the digit '1' after 'w1'. \n\nHere is the masked sequence:\n<sequence_start>w1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1w1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1r1r1i1i1i0w1i1i0i1i1r1i0i1r1i1i0i1i0i0w0i0i0w0i1i0r0r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w0w0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i0i0r0i0r0i0i1i1i1r0r0i0w1<masked_digit>r1w0i0r<sequence_end>"}
