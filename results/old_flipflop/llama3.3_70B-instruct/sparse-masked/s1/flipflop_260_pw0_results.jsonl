The digit immediately after this 'w' is '1'.\n\nSo, we replace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw1r1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1w0i1i0i1w0i1i1r0r0i0i1w0i0i1w0i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i0w1i1i0w1r1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0w0i1i0w0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i0w0i0r0i0r0i1i0i0r0i0w1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i0i1i0r1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i1i0w1i0r1w1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i1r becomes \nw1r1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1w0i1i0i1w0i1i1r0r0i0i1w0i0i1w0i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i0w1i1i0w1r1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0w0i1i0w0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i0w0i0r0i0r0i1i0i0r0i0w1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i0i1i0r1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i1i0w1i0r1w1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i1<masked_digit>i0r1w1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i1r\n\nHere is the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after this 'w' character.\n3. Replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the algorithmic solution:\n\nInput string: w0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1i0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0w1i0r1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i1w0w0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i1r\n\nFirst, we find the rightmost 'w' in the string. After examining the string, we find that the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string: ...i1i1i0r0i1i1w0w0...\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. We will replace this '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1i0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0w1i0r1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i1w0w0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0i1i1w<masked_digit>w0...</sequence_end>\n\nHowever, the above output is incorrect as per the given instructions. The correct output should be the entire input string with only the digit after the last 'w' masked. \n\nCorrecting the above response:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is followed by '0', so we replace this '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe correct masked sequence is:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1i0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0w1i0r1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i1w0w0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0i1i1w<masked_digit>w0</sequence_end>\n\nThis output still doesn't meet the requirements as the 'w' before the '<masked_digit>' should not be included in the output as it is not part of the original string's end. The correct output should be the input string with the last 'w' followed by '<masked_digit>' instead of '0'. \n\nCorrect output:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1i0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0w1i0r1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i1w0w0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0i1i1w<masked_digit>0</sequence_end>\n\nHowever, the above response still doesn't meet the requirements as the last 'w' should be followed by '<masked_digit>' and then '0' should be removed from the end.\n\nThe correct output is:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1i0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0w1i0r1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i1w0w0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0i1i1w<masked_digit></sequence_end>\n\nThis is still incorrect as the '0' at the end should be part of the string and '<masked_digit>' should replace the '0' after the last 'w'. \n\nThe correct output is:\nThe input string with the last '0' after 'w' replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nCorrect output:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1i0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0w1i0r1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i1w0w0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0r<sequence_end>"}
