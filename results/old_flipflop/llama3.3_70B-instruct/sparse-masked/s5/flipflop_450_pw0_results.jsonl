After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r.\n\nNext, I identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character. Since the 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it. However, this task requires masking a digit after a 'w'. Given the instruction, I will consider the last 'w' that has a digit after it.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, I find the last 'w' that has a digit after it: ...w1i1i1r1i1w... is not the last one, the actual last 'w' with a digit after it is ...i0w1i1i1r1i1w0... No, the last 'w' with a digit is actually ...i1i1i0w1...\n\nSo, the digit after the last 'w' with a digit is '1'. I will replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (that has a digit after it) masked:\n<sequence_start>w1i0i0i0r1i1i0r1i0i0w0i1i1i1i1i1w0i0r0i0i0w0i0w0i1i1i1i0i1i1w0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i0r0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1w0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1w0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0w0i1i1i0r0r0i0i1w0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1r0r0i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0w1i1i1r1i1w0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0r0i1i0i1i1i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r<sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1r0i0i0i0i1r.\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. \n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I see that there are multiple 'w' characters at the end, and the very last 'w' is followed by '0'. So, the correct replacement is the '0' after the last 'w'.\n\nHere is the corrected string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n<sequence_start>w0i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0w1i0i0i0w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0r1r1i0i1i1r1w0i0i1i0w0i1i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0w1i1w1i1i0i0r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0w0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1w0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0r0i1w1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0i1r1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1i1w1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r1w0i0i1i0w0w0i0w0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i1r<sequence_end>"}

Since this explanation did not execute the replacement, let's clarify the process:\n\n1. The input string is: w0i0i1i1r0i1i1r0w0i0i1i1i1r0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0r0i1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1w1i1r1i0i1i1i0i0i1w0r0w0r0r0i1i0i1i0i0i0r0r0i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1w0i1i0i1r0i1r0r0i1i0i1i0i1w1i0i0i0i0i0i0r1w1i0r1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1w1i1i1i0w1i1i0i1i0r1i0w1i0i1i1i0r1i0r1i1i0i0i1r1i1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1i1r1i1i0i0w1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0w1i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i1w1i1r1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0w1r1i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i1r1r1i0i1w0i0r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r\n\n2. The rightmost 'w' is near the end: ...i0i1w0i0r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r\n\n3. The digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n4. Replace '0' with <masked_digit>: ...i0i1w<masked_digit>i0r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r\n\nThus, the corrected masked sequence, with the digit after the rightmost 'w' replaced, is:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0i1i1r0i1i1r0w0i0i1i1i1r0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0r0i1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1w1i1r1i0i1i1i0i0i1w0r0w0r0r0i1i0i1i0i0i0r0r0i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1w0i1i0i1r0i1r0r0i1<sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string: ...i0i1w0...\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. However, since 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it to mask. But to follow the instructions precisely and given the nature of the task, I will consider the instruction as requiring the masking of the digit immediately after the last 'w' if it were present. Since there is no digit after the last 'w', the task as described does not apply in the conventional sense. However, to adhere to the format requested and demonstrate the process:\n\nGiven the input string ends with 'w', and there's no digit after it, the \"masking\" would theoretically apply to a non-existent digit. Thus, the string itself does not change because there's no digit to mask after the last 'w'. \n\nSo, the masked sequence, considering the instruction and the nature of the input, remains the same as the input string because there's no digit to mask after the rightmost 'w'. \n\n<sequence_start>w1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0i0i1i1i0r1i0r1i1i0i1i1r1w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0i0w0r0w1r1i1i1i0i1i0w0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0r0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r0i1i1i1i0w1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i0r1r1i0r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i1w0i1i0i1i0r0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1r</sequence_end><sequence_end>"}
