Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1w1i0i1i1w1i0i1i0i1w1i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1r1r1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0w0r0i1i1w1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1w1r1i1r1i0i0i1r1i1w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0w0i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1r0i0i1i0w1i0i1r1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i0r1i1i0w0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0r0i0i1i0i1w0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0i1r\n\nNow, let's find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1i0i1w0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0i1r\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. I will replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the masked digit:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1w1i0i1i1w1i0i1i0i1w1i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1r1r1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0w0r0i1i1w1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1w1r1i1r1i0i0i1r1i1w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0w0i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1r0i0i1i0w1i0i1r1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i0r1i1i0w0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0r0i0i1i0i1w0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0i1r<masked_digit>r0r0i0r0r0i1i0i1r<sequence_end>"}
