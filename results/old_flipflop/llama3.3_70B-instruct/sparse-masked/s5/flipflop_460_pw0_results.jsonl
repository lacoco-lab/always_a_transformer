However, since the 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it. But in the given string, the last 'w' is actually part of \"w0\" which is \"w0w0w0r0w1r1i0r1w0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0r0w0i1i0i1r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0i1i1r\". So the rightmost 'w' is in \"w0\" and the digit after it is \"0\".\n\nI will replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string is:\nw0i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i1i1w0w0i0r0i0i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0w0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0w0r0w1i1i0i0i1i1w1w1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i1w0r0i0r0i0w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1w1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r1r1w0w0w0r0w1r1i0r1w0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0r0w0i1i0i1r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0i1i1r\n\nbecomes\nw0i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i1i1w0w0i0r0i0i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0w0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0w0r0w1i1i0i0i1i1w1w1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i1w0r0i0r0i0w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1w1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r1r1w0w0w0r0w1r1i0r1w0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0r0w0i1i0i1r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0i1i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in \"w0\" and I will replace the \"0\" with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string:\nw<masked_digit>i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i1i1w0w0i0r0i0i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0w0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0w0r0w1i1i0i0i1i1w1w1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i1w0r0i0r0i0w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0<sequence_end>"}

However, considering the instruction to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and given that the very last 'w' does not have a digit after it, the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there is no digit to mask after the very last 'w'. \n\nHowever, following the instructions to the letter as requested and considering the spirit of the task, if we interpret the task as needing to find the last 'w' that has a digit after it and mask that digit, we would look at the second to last 'w' which is followed by a '0'. \n\nThus, the digit to be masked is '0'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\nGiven the interpretation that we are looking for the last 'w' that has a digit after it, the string would be modified as follows:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i1i0r0i0w1r1i0i0i0i1i0w1i1r1i0i1i0i1w1r1i1i1i0i0i0w1i0r1w0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0r0i1i1w1i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1r1i0w1r1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1w1i0i1i0w1i0w1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0r1i1i0i1w0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1w1i1i1r1i1i1i1i0w0w0i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i1r</sequence_start>\n\nHowever, given the confusion and the fact that the very last 'w' does not have a digit after it, and to follow the instructions precisely without assuming, the correct approach is to state that the task as described (masking the digit after the rightmost 'w') cannot be completed because there is no digit after the last 'w'. \n\nThus, the correct interpretation and action based on the provided instructions and the input string would be to not modify the string since the condition (having a digit after the rightmost 'w') is not met.\n\nThe final answer, following the format and instructions provided, and considering the clarification above, should reflect the original string as the task's condition is not fully met:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i1i0r0i0w1r1i0i0i0i1i0w1i1r1i0i1i0i1w1r1i1i1i0i0i0w1i0r1w0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0r0i1i1w1i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1r1i0w1r1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1w1i0i1i0w1i0w1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0r1i1i0i1w0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1w1i1i1r1i1i1i1i0w0w0i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i1r</sequence_start><sequence_end>"}
