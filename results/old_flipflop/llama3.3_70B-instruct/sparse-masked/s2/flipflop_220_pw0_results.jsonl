After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w0w0...\". Specifically, the last 'w' is the one right before the last sequence of characters.\n\nNow, I will identify the digit after the rightmost 'w'. The digit after the last 'w' is '0'.\n\nNext, I replace this digit with the <masked_digit> tag. The modified string will have the '0' after the last 'w' replaced with <masked_digit>.\n\nHere is the modified string with the masked digit:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0w0w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0i0w1r1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0w0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0w0i0i1i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0w0w0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0w0w0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0r0<masked_digit>0i0r</sequence_end>\n\nHowever, I realized the correct approach should directly replace the digit following the last 'w' without adding extra characters or altering the original string's structure beyond the specified replacement. The correct masking should directly replace the '0' after the last 'w' with <masked_digit>, without adding an extra '0' as I initially indicated.\n\nCorrecting my approach and directly applying the replacement to the original string without adding extra characters:\n\nThe correct sequence after masking the digit following the rightmost 'w' is:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0w0w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0i0w1r1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0w0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0w0i0i1i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0w0w0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0w0w0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0r0w<masked_digit>r</sequence_end><sequence_end>"}
