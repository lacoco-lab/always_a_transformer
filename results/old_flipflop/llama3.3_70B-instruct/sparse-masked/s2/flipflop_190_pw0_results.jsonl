This character should be a digit.\n\n3. **Mask the digit**: Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' in the string is the last 'w' before the end. After finding it, we see that it is followed by a '0'. So, we replace this '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1i0r0i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0r1i0i1r1i0i0i1w1i0i0i0r1r1i1i0r1r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i0i0r0i0w0i1i1i1i0i1i1r0i0<masked_digit></sequence_end>\n\nHowever, to accurately follow the instructions without manually scanning the string, which could lead to errors, let's clarify the process with a more detailed step-by-step approach that a computer program would take:\n\n1. Start from the end of the string and move backwards.\n2. The first 'w' encountered is the rightmost 'w'.\n3. The character immediately after this 'w' is the digit to be masked.\n4. Replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nGiven the nature of the task, the precise position of the rightmost 'w' and the digit to be masked requires scanning the string from right to left. The description provided earlier outlines the conceptual approach. For an exact solution, one would typically write a small program or script to perform these steps, especially for longer or more complex strings. \n\nGiven the constraints of this format, let's proceed with the understanding that the task involves identifying the rightmost 'w', finding the digit that follows it, and then masking that digit. The resulting string, with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked, is what we aim to produce.\n\nTo correctly identify and mask the digit following the rightmost 'w' without manual error, the process involves programming or a detailed, step-by-step analysis of the string from right to left. The key steps are finding the last 'w', identifying the following digit, and replacing it with '<masked_digit>'. \n\nFor the sake of providing a clear final answer based on the instructions and without the ability to execute code or manually scan the string with absolute accuracy in this response, let's focus on the method:\n\n- The input string is: w0i1i0r0i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0r1i0i1r1i0i0i1w1i0i0i0r1r1i1i0r1r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i0i0r0i0w0i1i1i1i0i1i1r0i0r\n- Find the rightmost 'w'.\n- The digit after this 'w' needs to be replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nGiven the nature of the instructions and the need for precision, the final masked sequence, following the exact steps outlined, would require identifying the last 'w' and masking the digit that immediately follows it. \n\nThus, the final answer, following the format and instructions provided, and considering the steps for masking the digit after the rightmost 'w', is:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1i0r0i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0r1i0i1r1i0i0i1w1i0i0i0r1r1i1i0r1r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i0i0r0i0w0i1i1i1i0i1i1r0i0<masked_digit></sequence_end><sequence_end>"}

This 'w' is found at the very end of the string.\n\n2. **Identify the digit after 'w'**: Since the 'w' is at the end, there is no digit after it. However, following the task's instruction to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and given there's no digit after the last 'w', we need to clarify the task's intention. Assuming the task implies masking the digit immediately after the last 'w' if there were any characters after it, but since there aren't, we'll consider the task as requiring no change because there's no digit to mask.\n\nHowever, to adhere strictly to the task as described and considering a potential misunderstanding in the interpretation, let's proceed under the assumption that we need to identify the last 'w' that has a digit after it, in case the instruction implies action only when a digit follows 'w'.\n\nUpon reviewing the string again for clarity and adherence to the task: The last 'w' that has a digit after it is actually \"w1\" before the last sequence of 'w's without following digits. Thus, the digit to be masked is '1'.\n\n3. **Mask the digit**: Replace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (that has a digit after it) masked is:\nw1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i1i0r1w1i0i1i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0w0i1i0r0i0i1r0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0w1i1i1i1w1w<masked_digit>i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1w1i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r\n\nGiven the potential for confusion in the task's description regarding the handling of the last 'w' without a following digit, the above solution assumes the intent was to mask the digit after the last 'w' that has a digit following it.\n\n<sequence_start>w1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i1i0r1w1i0i1i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0w0i1i0r0i0i1r0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0w1i1i1i1w1w<masked_digit>i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1w1i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r<sequence_end>"}

However, following the instruction strictly to mask the digit after the 'w' character, we consider the sequence 'w0i1', the digit directly after 'w' is '0', and the digit after 'w0' in the sequence is '1'. Given the task's specificity, it seems we should consider '0' as the digit to mask because it directly follows 'w' in 'w0'. \n\nHowever, re-evaluating for clarity: The task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', which would be '0' in 'w0', but considering the sequence flow, the confusion arises from interpreting \"after the 'w' character.\" If we strictly follow the sequence without assuming 'w' is a separate entity from 'w0', then '0' is the digit to consider for masking because it's part of 'w0', and there's no digit immediately following 'w' without considering 'w0' as a unit.\n\nGiven this, the correct approach to the task as described would indeed focus on the digit '0' in 'w0' for masking since it's the digit directly associated with the last occurrence of 'w'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe digit to be replaced is '0' in 'w0'. Replacing it gives us 'w<masked_digit>'.\n\nNow, let's apply this replacement in the original string:\n\nOriginal string with the replacement: w1r1r1i0i1r1i0w0i0w0i1w0i0i1i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i0w0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1w0i0r0i1i1r0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1r becomes:\nw1r1r1i0i1r1i0w0i0w0i1w0i0i1i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i0w0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1w0i0r0i1i1r0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1w1i0i1i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1r\n\nCorrected approach for clarity and adherence to the task:\nThe rightmost 'w' is in 'w0', and the digit to mask is indeed '0'.

Given the input string and following the steps:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is near the end: \"...i0i1w0i0i1i0r\"\n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.
