Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw0i1i0i0i1i0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1w0r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0w0i0i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i0w0i1w0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1r0i0i1r0i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0r1i1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1w0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0w0r0r0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1r1i0w1i1i0w1i1r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0w0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0w1i1r1i0w0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0r\n\nFirst, I find the rightmost 'w' character in the string. After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the position before the last 'w1' or 'w0'. \n\nUpon closer inspection, the last 'w' is 'w1' and it is followed by 'i1r1i0w0'. The 'w' before 'w1' is 'w0' and it is followed by 'i1w0'. The 'w' before 'w0' is 'w1' and it is followed by 'i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1r1i0w1'. \n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is 'w1' and it is followed by 'i1r1i0w0'. The digit after 'w1' is '1'. \n\nNow, I replace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string:\n<sequence_start>w0i1i0i0i1i0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1w0r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0w0i0i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i0w0i1w0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1r0i0i1r0i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0r1i1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1w0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0w0r0r0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1r1i0w1i1i0w1i1r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0w0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0w1<masked_digit>r1i0w0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0r<sequence_end>"}

Let's correct that by actually finding the last 'w' and masking the digit after it.\n\nAfter re-examining the string, the last 'w' is found to be at the position before the last '0'. So, the correct masking should be applied to the digit immediately after the last 'w', which is indeed '0'. \n\nHere is the corrected output with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i0i1i0i0i0i1r1i0w0i0i1r0w0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i1w0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0w1r1i1r1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i0i1r1i1w1i1i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1i0r1w0i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1r0i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1w0i1i0r0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i1w1i1i0i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1w1i1w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r0i1w0i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i1r0w0i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r0w0r0i0w<masked_digit></sequence_end><sequence_end>"}

Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw1i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1w1i0i0r1i1i0w0i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0w1i1r1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i0w1i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i1w1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0w1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0r1i1i0r1i1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0i1w1i1i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1w0r0i0i0i0r0i0r0r0i0w1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1r\n\nFirst, I find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r\".\n\nNext, I identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w', which is '1'.\n\nNow, I replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw1i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1w1i0i0r1i1i0w0i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0w1i1r1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i0w1i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i1w1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0w1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0r1i1i0r1i1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0i1w1i1i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1w0r0i0i0i0r0i0r0r0i0w1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1r becomes \nw1i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1w1i0i0r1i1i0w0i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0w1i1r1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i0w1i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i1w1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0w1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0r1i1i0r1i1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0i1w1i1i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1w0r0i0i0i0r0i0r0r0i0w1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1<masked_digit>\n\nHere is the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
