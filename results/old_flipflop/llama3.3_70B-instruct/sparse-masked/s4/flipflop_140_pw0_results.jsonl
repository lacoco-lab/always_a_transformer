Find the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1r0i1r<w>.\n\n2. Identify the digit after the rightmost 'w' character:\nSince the 'w' is at the end, there is no digit after it. However, the task asks to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Given the string ends with 'w' and there's no digit after it to mask, the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there's no digit to mask. \n\nHowever, to follow the instructions as closely as possible and to provide a response that fits the requested format, I will treat the task as requiring the identification of the rightmost 'w' and then handle the absence of a following digit by noting it in the output.\n\nGiven the constraints and the input, the output reflecting the process would be:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0r0i0w1i1i1i0i1r1i1r1i0i0r1i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1w0r0r0i0w0i1w0i1r0i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1r</sequence_end>\n\nNote: Since there's no digit after the rightmost 'w' to mask, the original string is presented as is within the tags, with an understanding that the task's specific request to mask a digit after the rightmost 'w' cannot be fulfilled due to the absence of such a digit.<sequence_end>"}
