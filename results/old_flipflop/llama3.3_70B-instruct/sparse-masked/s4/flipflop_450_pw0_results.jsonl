Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw1i0i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0w0w0i0i1i1i1r0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i0i1w0i1r0i0r0i0i1r0i0i1i0w0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0w1i1i0i0i1w1i1i1i0r1i1r1i1w1i1i0r1r1i1i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1w0i1w0i1i0i1r0i0i1r0i0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i0w1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0w0i1i1r0r0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1w0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i1i0w0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r\n\nFirst, I find the rightmost 'w' character in the string. After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0i1i0i1r\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is the last character in the string, and the digit after it does not exist because 'w' is the last character. However, according to the task, I should mask the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Since there is no digit after the last 'w', I will consider the task as requiring the masking of the digit immediately after the second rightmost 'w' if the rightmost 'w' does not have a following digit.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, I find the second rightmost 'w' and the digit after it: ...w0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0w0i1w0... The digit after the second rightmost 'w' is '0', but I need to check if there's a 'w' with a digit immediately after it closer to the end of the string.\n\nAfter a detailed examination, I find that the last 'w' with a digit after it is indeed ...i0i1i0i1r is not correct since 'w' is the last character, and I should look for 'w' followed by a digit. The correct 'w' followed by a digit is ...w0... where '0' is the digit after 'w'.\n\nThus, the digit to be masked is '0'. \n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (considering the second rightmost 'w' since the last 'w' does not have a digit after it) masked is:\nw1i0i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0w0w0i0i1i1i1r0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i0i1w0i1r0i0r0i0i1r0i0i1i0w0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0w1i1i0i0i1w1i1i1i0r1i1r1i1w1i1i0r1r1i1i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1w0i1w0i1i0i1r0i0i1r0i0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i0w1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0w0i1i1r0r0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1w0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i1i0w0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' with a digit after it is ...w<masked_digit>... where <masked_digit> replaces '0'. \n\nHere is the masked sequence:\n<sequence_start>w1i0i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0w0w0i0i1i1i1r0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i0i1w0i1r0i0r0i0i1r0i0i1i0w0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0w1i1i0i0i1w1i1i1i0r1i1r1i1w1i1i0r1r1i1i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1w0i1w0i1i0i1r0i0i1r0i0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i0w1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0w0i1i1r0r0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1w0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i1i0w0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r<sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1i1r0i1r.\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. However, since 'w' is at the end, there is no digit after it to mask.\n\nBut, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually part of 'w0' which is not at the very end but 'w' is indeed at the end in 'w0w0'. The last 'w' in 'w0w0' does not have a digit after it to mask because it is at the end of the string. However, the 'w' before the last 'w' in 'w0w0' has a '0' after it.\n\nSo, the correct 'w' to consider for masking the digit after it is the 'w' in 'w0' before 'w0' at the end. The digit after this 'w' is '0'. \n\nNow, let's replace this '0' with '<masked_digit>':\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (considering the 'w' before the last 'w' in 'w0w0') masked is:\nw1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0w1w1i0i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i0i1i0r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0w<masked_digit>i0i0i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0r0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1r0w0i0r0i1w1i1i0i0i0r1i0i0r1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i1r1i0i1w1i0i0i1w1r1i0r1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1w0w0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i1w0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0w0i1i1r0i1r\n\nHere is the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}

The correct rightmost 'w' is actually ...i1i1i1i0i0r0r0i1i1i0i0w1... The correct masking should be applied to the digit '0' after the 'w' in ...w0... at the end of the string, but since there is no '0' after the last 'w1', we look for the last 'w' and find ...w1i0... The digit after 'w1' is 'i', not a digit, we continue looking and find ...w0i0... The digit after 'w0' is 'i', not a digit, we continue looking and find ...w0r0...

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1w1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i1r\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. I will replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0i1r0i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0r1i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1r1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i1i1w0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0w0i0i0i1i0i1w0i0r0i1i0w0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0w1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0w1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1r1i0i1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i1r1i1i0i0i1i0<masked_digit>i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i1r<sequence_end>"}
