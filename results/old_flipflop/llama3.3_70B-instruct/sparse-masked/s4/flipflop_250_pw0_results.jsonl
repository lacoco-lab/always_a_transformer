After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1r.\n\nNow, I will mask the digit after the rightmost 'w' character. However, since the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it to mask.\n\nBut, if we consider the second rightmost 'w', it is followed by a '1'. So, if we were to mask the digit after the second rightmost 'w', we would replace the '1' with <masked_digit>.\n\nHowever, the task specifically asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w'. Since there is no digit after the rightmost 'w', the task as described does not apply in the conventional sense because there's no digit to mask after the last 'w'. \n\nGiven the instruction to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w' and considering the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string with no following digit, the original string does not require any masking based on the provided criteria.\n\nTherefore, the sequence remains unchanged as there's no digit to mask after the rightmost 'w'.
