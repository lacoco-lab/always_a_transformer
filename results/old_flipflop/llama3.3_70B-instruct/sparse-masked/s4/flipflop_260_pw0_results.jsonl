Let's correct that and provide the accurate masked sequence:\n\nCorrectly identifying the rightmost 'w' and the digit after it, and then replacing that digit with '<masked_digit>' gives us the correct sequence.

The correct placement should be directly after the last 'w' in the sequence, which is at the position \"...w<masked_digit>i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r\".

Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after this 'w' character.\n3. Replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the algorithmic solution:\n\nInput string: w1i1i1i0i0r1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1w1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0w1r1i0w0r0w0i0i1i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0r0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i1i1r\n\nStep 1: Find the rightmost 'w' character.\n\nAfter examining the string, the rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string: ...i1i1r0i1i1r\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is the last character before the digits that follow.\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after this 'w' character.\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. However, upon closer inspection, it appears there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the exact position of the last 'w' and the subsequent digit. Let's correct this and accurately identify the last 'w' and the digit that follows it.\n\nCorrecting the oversight: The actual last 'w' in the sequence is indeed near the end, and upon re-examining, we find the sequence ends with \"...i1i1r\". This means the last 'w' is actually before the last set of digits and characters. The correct sequence to examine for the last 'w' and subsequent digit is \"...w0r0w0i0i1i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0r0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i1i1r\". \n\nThe last 'w' is in \"...w0r0w0...\". The digit immediately after the last 'w' in this corrected context is '0', which is part of \"...w0...\". \n\nStep 3: Replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe input string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i1i1i0i0r1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1w1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0w1r1i0w0r0w<masked_digit>r0i0i0i0i1i0i0r0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i1i1r<sequence_end>"}

We start from the end of the string and move towards the beginning until we find a 'w'.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is found at the position from the end: ...i1i1i1i1i0r (this 'w' is not present here, moving further to the left) ...w0i0w0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i0r (still not here, moving further to the left) ...i0w1r1w0i0w0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is actually: ...i0w1r1w0i0w0... The 'w' that is rightmost is the last 'w' in this sequence, which is followed by '0'. \n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.
