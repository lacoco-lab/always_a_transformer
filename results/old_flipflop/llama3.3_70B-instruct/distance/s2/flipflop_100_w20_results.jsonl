Start from the end of the string and move towards the beginning.\n2. Find the first 'w' character encountered.\n3. Print the character immediately after this 'w' character.\n\nLet's apply this process to the given string:\n\nThe string is: w1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1w1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0i1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1i1i0i0i0i0r1r1r1r\n\nStarting from the end and moving towards the beginning, we find the first 'w' character. However, to simplify the explanation, let's break down the string into parts to identify the last occurrence of 'w' more easily:\n\n...i1i0i0i0i0r1r1r1r (this part does not contain 'w', so we continue looking)\n...i1i0i0i0r1r1r1i1 (still no 'w')\n...r1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1 (no 'w' here either)\n...i0i0i0r1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1i1i0i0i0i0r1r1r1r (no 'w' in this segment)\n...1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1w1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0i1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1i1i0i0i0i0r1r1r1r (found a 'w' here)\n...w1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1w... (another 'w' is found earlier in the string, but we are interested in the last one)\nThe last 'w' is in: ...1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1w...\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is followed by '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
