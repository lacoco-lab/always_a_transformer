The 'w' in question is actually the second last 'w' from the left, but since we're looking from right to left, it's the first 'w' we encounter from the end. The string ending is \"...i1i1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1r1i0i1i1r1i1i0r\", and the 'w' before this part is \"w1...\". So, the 'w' we are interested in is followed by \"1\".\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
