The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string: ...i1i1i1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1i0r. There's no 'w' at the end, my mistake. Let me recheck: The string actually ends with ...0i1i1i1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1i0r, and upon re-examining, I see 'w' appears earlier: ...i0w1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i1i1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1i0r. The rightmost 'w' is in ...i0w...\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
