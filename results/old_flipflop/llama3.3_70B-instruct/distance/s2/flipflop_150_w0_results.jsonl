Upon inspection, the rightmost 'w' is actually at the beginning of the string because there are no other 'w's beyond the first one.\n\n2. **Find the digit after 'w'**: Since 'w' is at the start of the string, the character immediately following it is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
