Then, we will find the character immediately to its right, which should be the digit we are looking for.\n\nGiven Input: w1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1w1i0r1i0i0i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i1i1r\n\n1. Locate the rightmost 'w':\n   - Starting from the end of the string and moving left, the first 'w' encountered is the rightmost 'w'.\n   - The string ends with \"...i1r1r1i0i1i1r\", so moving left, the rightmost 'w' is found in \"...r1w1i0...\".\n\n2. Find the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - The 'w' in question is \"...r1w1...\", so the digit immediately after 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
