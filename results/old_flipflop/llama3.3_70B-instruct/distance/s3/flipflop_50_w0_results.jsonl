Find the last occurrence of 'w' in the string.\n2. Check the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If the character is a digit (0 or 1), print it.\n\nHere's how I'll do it:\n\nInput string: w0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1i1r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0r\n\nLast 'w' is at the beginning, so I'll look for 'w' from the end of the string:\n...i0r0r0i0r\n\nThe last 'w' is not found in the middle or end, it's only at the start, so the string after the last 'w' is: 0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1i1r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0r\n\nThe character immediately after 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
