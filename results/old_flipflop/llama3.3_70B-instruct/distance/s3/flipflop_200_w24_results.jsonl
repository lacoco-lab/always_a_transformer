Locate the rightmost 'w' in the given string:\n   - Upon examining the string from right to left, the rightmost 'w' is found near the end: \"...i0r0i0i0i1i1i0r\"\n\n3. Identify the character immediately following the rightmost 'w':\n   - The character right after the 'w' in \"...i0r0i0i0i1i1i0r\" is not visible because the 'w' is not explicitly shown in this snippet. Let's correct that and actually find the last 'w' and the digit after it in the original string.\n\nCorrect approach:\n- The original string is: w1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1w0r0i0i0r0i0r0r0i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0r0r0i0r0i1i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i0i0r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0r0r0i0i0i1r0r0i1i1i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0i1i1i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i0r\n- The last 'w' is actually actually at the beginning and another one is \"w0\".\n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

The rightmost 'w' is found at the position where \"w0\" appears last in the string.\n2. Looking at the string from right to left, the last occurrence of 'w' is in \"wi1r0...\". Thus, the rightmost 'w' is followed by 'i', not a digit. However, my initial approach to directly identify the digit after 'w' was incorrect because I should have considered the entire string to ensure accuracy. The correct step involves checking each 'w' from right to left and identifying the first 'w' that is directly followed by a digit, which in this explanation was initially overlooked.\n\nCorrecting the approach:\nUpon re-examining the string, we notice that the last 'w' is actually followed by an 'i', not a digit. The task, however, asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Since the direct approach to find 'w' followed by a digit was misleading due to the presence of characters between 'w's and digits, let's accurately identify the rightmost 'w' and then find the next digit.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' in the string is indeed part of \"w0\" which appears towards the end. The correct sequence to consider is finding the last 'w' and then looking for the digit immediately after it, which in the case of the last \"w0\" is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
