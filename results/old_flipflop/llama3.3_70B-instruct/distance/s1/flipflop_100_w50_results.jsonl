The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string: ...r1r1i0r is followed by no 'w', but looking further to the left, we find 'w1' which is the last occurrence of 'w'.\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
