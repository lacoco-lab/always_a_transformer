The digit immediately after it does not exist because 'w' is the last character. However, since the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', and there is no digit after the last 'w', the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there's no digit to mask.\n\nBut, if we consider the task as needing to identify the last 'w' and then handle the absence of a digit after it, the sequence remains unchanged because there's no digit to mask after the last 'w'. \n\nThus, the masked sequence, considering the instruction and the input provided, would be the original string itself since there's no digit to mask after the rightmost 'w'. \n\n<sequence_start>w1r1r1r1i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i0r1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1i0i1r1i1i0w1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0i0i1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0i0i1r1r1i0i1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i0i0i0i0r1r1i0i1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i0i0r1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1i0r1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1r1r1i1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1r1r1r1w<sequence_end>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw0i1r0i1i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i0r0w1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i0i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0i0i0i0r1r1i0r1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i0i0r1i0r1i0i0i0r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1r1r\n\nNow, let's find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"r1r1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1r1r\".\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. \n\nHere is the masked sequence:\n<sequence_start>w0i1r0i1i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i0r0w1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i0i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0i0i0i0r1r1i0r1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i0i0r1i0r1i0i0i0r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1r1<masked_digit>r</sequence_end>\n\nNote: Since the 'w' is at the end of the string, the '<masked_digit>' tag is placed after it, replacing the '1' that was originally there, but in this case, there is no digit after the last 'w' to mask. The task was to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', but since there is no digit after the last 'w', the sequence remains the same except for adding the '<masked_digit>' tag at the end to signify the position where the masking would have occurred if there were a digit to mask.<sequence_end>"}

However, this task requires masking a digit after 'w', so we need to find the last 'w' that has a digit after it.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, the last 'w' with a digit after it is 'w0' near the beginning of the string. The digit after this 'w' is '0'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\nReplace '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (that has a digit after it) masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w<masked_digit>i1i1i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0r0r0i1r0r0w0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1r0r0i1i0i0r0i1i0i1r0r0i0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0i1i1r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0i0i1i1r0r0i0i1r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i0i1r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1i1i0i1r0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1r<sequence_end>"}

However, considering the task requires masking a digit after 'w', and there's no 'w' followed by a digit at the very end, we look for the last occurrence of 'w' that is followed by a digit. The last 'w' followed by a digit is 'w0'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\nThe digit '0' after the 'w' will be replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (that is followed by a digit) masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1i1i1i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0r0i0r0r0w<masked_digit>i1r0r0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0i1r0r0r0i0i1i0r0i0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i1i1i1r0i0r0i1i0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0i1i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i1r0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i0r0i0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1i0i0r0i0i1i0i1r0i0r0i0r0i1r0i0i1i1i1i1i1r0r0i1i0r<sequence_end>"}
