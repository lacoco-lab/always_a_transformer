After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the position where 'w1' appears.\n\nNext, I identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w', which is '1'.\n\nNow, I replace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string is: w0i0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i0w<masked_digit>i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i0r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i0r1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i0i0i1i1r\n\nFinally, I put the modified string between '<sequence_start>' and '<sequence_end>"}
