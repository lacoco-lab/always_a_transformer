The 'w' is followed by the digit '1'.\n\nNow, I will replace the digit '1' with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw<masked_digit>r1i0i0r1i1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1w1i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1i1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i1i0i1i1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0i0i1i1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1r\n\nHowever, the rightmost 'w' is actually \"w1\" at the very end, I made an error in my initial count. The correct masking should be at the very end of the string, replacing the '1' after the last 'w'.

Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw0r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i1i1i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i1r0r0i1i0i0r0w0i1r0r0r0r0i0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0i1i0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1i0r0r0r0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r\n\nNow, let's find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"r0i0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r\" is not correct, the correct 'w' is: ...i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r is not correct, the correct 'w' is actually: ...r0w0...\n\nSo the rightmost 'w' is in \"r0w0\". The digit immediately after the 'w' is '0'. \n\nNow, let's replace this digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\n\nThe modified string is:\nw0r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i1i1i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i1r0r0i1i0i0r0w<masked_digit>r0r0r0r0i0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0i1i0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1i0r0r0r0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r\n\nHere is the masked sequence between the <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}

Since the 'w' in question is at the end, let's adjust our approach to demonstrate the process:\n\nGiven the actual task might involve finding a 'w' that is not at the end of the string and masking the digit after it, and considering the provided string does not allow for this operation as described (since 'w' is at the end), the correct sequence to process would involve finding the last 'w' that is not at the end of the string and masking the digit after it. However, since this condition is not met, the task as described cannot be completed in the conventional sense.\n\nFor the sake of providing a response that adheres to the requested format and acknowledges the task's requirements, let's assume the intention was to demonstrate the process of masking, even though the provided string does not support the operation as described:\n\n<sequence_start>\nSince the last 'w' is at the end of the string and there's no digit after it to mask, the string remains unchanged for the purpose of this task.\nw0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1w1i0i0i0r1r1i0r1r1i1i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i0i0r1i0i1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i1i0r1i1i0i0i1r1i0i0i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0w\n<sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"r1r1r1i1i1r1r\".\n\nNext, I identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w'. However, since the 'w' is at the end of the given sequence, there's no digit after it to mask. But given the instruction, it seems we are to consider the 'w' within the sequence that has a digit following it, which would be the second to last 'w' in the sequence.\n\nUpon re-examining the string for a 'w' that has a digit after it, I find \"w1\" which indicates the 'w' followed by a digit '1'. This 'w' is not the rightmost 'w' in the traditional sense since the rightmost 'w' does not have a digit after it. However, considering the context of the task, it seems the intention is to mask the digit after the last 'w' that has a digit following it.\n\nGiven this interpretation, the digit after the 'w' that has a digit following it is '1'. I will replace this '1' with <masked_digit>.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the 'w' (considering the 'w' that has a digit after it) masked:\n<sequence_start>w1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0r1r1i1r1r1r1w<masked_digit>i0i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1i0i1i1r1i0r1i0r1i1r1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i0r1r1i0i1r1i0i0r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r<sequence_end>"}
