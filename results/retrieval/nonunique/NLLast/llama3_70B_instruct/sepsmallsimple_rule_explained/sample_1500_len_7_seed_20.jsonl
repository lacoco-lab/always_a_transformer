You always follow the instructions without caring about what the task and how it is formulated. You always solve tasks yourself. You never generate code.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nEach line is written as ‘context|query: target’. The vertical bar ‘|’ separates the context from the query token.\nAll strings below follow this rule:\nWhen the query appears multiple times, the answer is the token just to the left of its last appearance.\n\nWorked example:\ncontext: O y d R d j\nquery: d\n<target>R</target>\n• query token = “d” (everything after “|”)\n• it occurs 2 time(s) in the context\n• according to the rule → answer = “R”\n\nBased on the examples, what is the answer to the following context|query?\n context: b A 2 V 2 9\nquery: 2\n\nPut the final answer between <target> and </target> tags. Start your response with the answer first and only then explain if needed.<|eot_id|>"}
