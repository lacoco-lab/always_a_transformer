You always follow the instructions without caring about what the task and how it is formulated. You always solve tasks yourself. You never generate code.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nEach line is written as ‘context|query: target’. The vertical bar ‘|’ separates the context from the query token.\nAll strings below follow this rule:\nThe answer is the token immediately to the left of the single instance of the query token.\n\nWorked example:\ncontext: H p y M b\nquery: y\n<target>p</target>\n• query token = “y” (everything after “|”)\n• it occurs 1 time(s) in the context\n• according to the rule → answer = “p”\n\nBased on the examples, what is the answer to the following context|query?\n context: k 2 5 t D q\nquery: 2\n\nPut the final answer between <target> and </target> tags. Start your response with the answer first and only then explain if needed.<|im_end|>\n"}
