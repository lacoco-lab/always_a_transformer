Once we have identified the position of the 'w', we then check the digit in that position.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `lastPosition` to keep track of the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (to find the rightmost 'w').\n3. If the current character is 'w', update `lastPosition` to the current position.\n4. After the loop, `lastPosition` will hold the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n5.
