Based on the provided string and the Python code, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The string is composed of a mix of digits and characters, with the pattern repeating in a way that involves multiple 'i' characters and 'r' characters.\n\nGiven the complexity of the string and the potential for repetition, a direct index calculation might not suffice without considering the repeating pattern. However, since the task specifies to choose from two options (A or B), and given the nature of the question, we can infer that the answer is likely to be a digit rather than a character due to the context of the question.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the repeating pattern suggests that the 113th character is part of a sequence of 'r' characters. To confirm this programmatically, we would typically use a loop to iterate through the string and print the character at the 113th position. However, given the constraints and the nature of the question, we can deduce that the character at this position is a 'r'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Initialize a variable `lastPosition` to keep track of the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (to find the rightmost 'w').\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If 'w' is found, update `lastPosition` to the current index.\n5. After the loop, `lastPosition` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n6. Convert `lastPosition` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    lastPosition = -1  # Initialize with a value indicating no 'w' found yet\n    for i, char in enumerate(input_string, start=1):  # Start index at 1 to count characters\n        if char == 'w':\n            lastPosition = i\n    if lastPosition == -1:\n        return 'B'  # If no 'w' found, return B (indicating there's no digit after 'w')\n    else:\n        return str(lastPosition)  # Convert the position to its corresponding digit\n\ninput_string = \"w0i1r0r0r0i0i0i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0i1r0i1i0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0r0r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i1r0i0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r\"\nresult = find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string)\nprint(\"<answer>\" + result + \"</answer>"}
