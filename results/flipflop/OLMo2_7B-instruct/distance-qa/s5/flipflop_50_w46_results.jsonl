The string is \"w1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i1r1i0i1r1i1r1r1w1r\". Counting the characters, we see there are 19 characters in total.\n2. The rightmost 'w' is the 19th character.\n3. The character immediately after the 19th position is the 20th character.\n\nNow, let's count the characters in the string to find the 20th character:\n\n- Characters before 'w': w, 1, r, 1, r, 1, r, 1, r, 1, r, 1, r, 1, r, 1, i, 0, i, 1, r, 1, r, 1\n- Counting these, we have 18 characters before the 'w'.\n\nTherefore, the 20th character is the first character of the substring starting from the 20th position.\n\nLet's identify this character:\n\nThe string from the 20th to the 19th position is \"i0i1r\".\n\nSo, the 20th character is 'i'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
