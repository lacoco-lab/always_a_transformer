The next character after the 63rd character is the 64th character.\n\nNow, let's look at the 64th character in the string:\n- The pattern repeats every 3 characters: 'w', 'r', 'i'\n- The 64th character falls in the position corresponding to the 'i' in the 22nd cycle (since 64 % 3 = 1, and the 1st position in the next cycle is 'i').\n\nTherefore, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is 'i'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}
