To find the character immediately after the 16th character, we need to consider the length of the string and the positions of the other characters.\n\nThe string length is 18 characters. The characters before the rightmost 'w' are:\n- w\n- 1\n- i\n- 0\n- i\n- 1\n- r\n- 1\n- i\n- 1\n- i\n- 0\n- i\n- 0\n- r\n- 1\n\nThis totals 13 characters before the 'w'. Therefore, the character immediately after the 16th 'w' is the 18th character in the string.\n\nThe 18th character is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

To find the character at position 14, we need to consider the length of the string and the characters that make it up.\n\nThe string \"w1r1r1i0i0i0i1r1w1r\" has 15 characters in total.\n\n- The first 'w' is at position 0.\n- The last 'r' is at position 14.\n\nSince we are looking for the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' (position 13), we need to examine the characters before position 14.\n\nThe characters before position 14 are: \"i0i0i0\".\n\nThe third 'i' in \"i0i0i0\" is at position 2.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '2'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

To find the character at position 14 (since positions are 0-indexed), we look at the string \"w0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0\".\n\nThe character at position 14 in the string \"w0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0\" is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
