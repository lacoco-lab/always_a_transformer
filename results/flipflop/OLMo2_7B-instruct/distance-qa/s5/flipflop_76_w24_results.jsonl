The question asks for the digit **after** the rightmost 'w', which implies looking at the immediate next character in the sequence of numbers and letters that follow the 'w'.\n\nThe sequence after 'w' is a series of digits and letters, and the next logical digit in this sequence (considering the pattern) would be '0' (as the string is structured with alternating digits and letters, and the pattern suggests a continuation with a '0').\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
