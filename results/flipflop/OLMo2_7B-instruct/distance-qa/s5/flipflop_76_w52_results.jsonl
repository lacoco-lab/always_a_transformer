Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' character.\n2. Determine the character immediately after this 'w'.\n3. Convert this character to its corresponding digit (if it represents a digit).\n\nLet's break down the string and find the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput: w0r0i0r0i1i0i0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1r0i0i1w1r1i0i0r1r1i1r1i1r\n\n- The rightmost 'w' is at position 37.\n\nNow, let's look at the character immediately after position 37:\n\n- The character at position 37 is '0'.\n\nSince '0' is not a digit, we need to consider the next character to the right, which is at position 38:\n\n- The character at position 38 is 'r'.\n\nSince 'r' is not a digit either, we continue to the next character:\n\n- The character at position 39 is 'i'.\n\nAgain, 'i' is not a digit. Continuing this process:\n\n- The character at position 40 is '0'.\n\nThis '0' is the first digit we encounter after the rightmost 'w'. Therefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
