In Python, this can be done using the `str.rindex()` method, which returns the index of the last occurrence of a specified character.\n\nLet's find the index of the last 'w':\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i1i0r0i0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0i0r0i0i1r0i1r0i0i1i0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0i0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0i0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i0r0r0i0i0r0i1r0i0w1r1i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1r1i0i1i0r1i1i1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r\"\nlast_w_index = input_string.rindex('w')\n```\n\nThe index of the last 'w' is `26`. Now, we need to find the character at index `26` in the string. Since the string is zero-indexed, the 26th index corresponds to position `25` in a 1-based index system.\n\nLet's retrieve the character at index `25`:\n```python\ncharacter_at_25th_index = input_string[last_w_index]\n```\n\nThe character at index `25` is '0'. Therefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
