Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' character in the string.\n2. Determine the character immediately following this 'w'.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The string is: \"w1i0r1r1r1i1w1i0i1r\"\n2. Find the position of the rightmost 'w':\n   - The string ends with 'r', so we need to count the characters from the end to find the last 'w'.\n   - The characters from the end: 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'r' -> Total 4 characters.\n   - The last 'w' is at the 5th position (0-indexed).\n\n3. Determine the character at the 5th position:\n   - The characters in the string are: 'w', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'r'.\n   - The 5th character is '1'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
