The string is composed of alternating characters, starting with 'w', followed by 'r', then 'i', and repeating this pattern. We can count the number of complete cycles of this pattern and then find the position of the last 'w'.\n\n0 complete cycle consists of:\n- 1 'w'\n- 1 'r'\n- 1 'i'\n\nSo, each cycle has 3 characters.\n\nThe string length is 63 characters. To find the number of complete cycles:\n\\[ \\text{Number of cycles} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{63}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 21 \\]\n\n0fter 21 cycles, we have:\n\\[ 21 \\times 3 = 63 \\text{ characters} \\]\n\nThe 21st cycle ends with 'w'.

The rightmost 'w' is the last occurrence of 'w' in the string. We can achieve this by iterating through the string from the end to the beginning and checking for the character 'w'.\n\nOnce we find the rightmost 'w', we look at the character immediately to its right. In Python, we can use the `index` method to find the position of the 'w' and then access the next character using the `[-1]` index (since list indexing starts from 0, `-1` refers to the last element).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0i0r1i0r1i0i0r1i0i1r1i1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i0i0r1i1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Get the character immediately after the rightmost 'w'\nafter_w_char = input_string[rightmost_w_index - 1]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"<answer>\" + after_w_char + \"</answer>"}
