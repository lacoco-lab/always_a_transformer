For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If 'w' is found, update `lastPosition` to the current index.\n5. After the loop, `lastPosition` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n6. Convert `lastPosition` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    # Initialize the last position of 'w'\n    last_position = -1\n    \n    # Iterate from the end to the beginning of the string\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            last_position = i\n            break\n    \n    # Convert the position to the corresponding digit (0 or 1)\n    digit = str(last_position)\n    \n    # Return the digit\n    return <answer>digit</answer>"}

Once we have identified the position of the 'w', we then look at the character immediately to its right.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1.
