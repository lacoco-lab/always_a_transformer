The rightmost 'w' is the last occurrence of 'w' in the string. We can achieve this by iterating through the string from the end to the beginning and checking for the character 'w'.\n\nOnce we find the rightmost 'w', we look at the character immediately to its right.

Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w'. The string is structured with alternating characters and spaces, and the 'w' characters appear in a specific pattern.\n\nBy examining the string, we can see that the 'w' characters are interspersed with other characters in a repeating sequence. The sequence of characters before 'w' is \"i1r1i1r1i0\" and repeats every 5 characters.\n\nTo find the position of the last 'w':\n- The sequence \"i1r1i1r1i0\" repeats every 5 characters.\n- The last 'w' appears at the position that is a multiple of 5.\n\nLet's count the positions:\n- The first 'w' is at position 5.\n- The second 'w' is at position 10 (5 * 2).\n- The third 'w' is at position 15 (5 * 3).\n- The fourth 'w' is at position 20 (5 * 4).\n- The fifth 'w' is at position 25 (5 * 5).\n\nSince the string length is 81 characters, the last 'w' will be at position 80 (81 - 1).\n\nNow, we need to determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w' at position 80. The string is structured such that every 5 characters form a block, and within each block, the pattern is \"i1r1i1r1i0\".\n\nThe block at position 80:\n- The first character of the block is 'i' (at position 1 within the block).\n- The second character is '1'.\n- The third character is 'r'.\n- The fourth character is '1'.\n- The fifth character is 'i'.\n- The sixth character is '0' (at position 6 within the block).\n\nThus, the digit directly to the right of the last 'w' is the character at position 81 of the entire string, which is the '0' in the sixth position of the block.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
