Since we are looking for the last occurrence of 'w', `-1` indicates that 'w' is the last character in the string.\n\nNow, let's find the character at the position immediately following the last 'w':\n\n```python\nif last_w_index == -1:\n    result = 'No \"w\" found'\nelse:\n    result = input_string[last_w_index + 1]\n```\n\nGiven the string provided, the last 'w' is indeed the last character, so `last_w_index` will be `-1`. Therefore, we need to check the character at index `0` (since indices start at 0).\n\nThe character at index `0` in the string is 'i0'. Hence, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nThe answer is:\n<answer>0</answer>"}
