Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Determine the character at the next position.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The string is \"w0r0i0r0i0r0r0i0w0r\". Counting the positions from 0, the rightmost 'w' is at position 11.\n2. To find the character at position 12 (since positions are 0-indexed), we look at the string \"w0r0i0r0i0r0r0i0w0r\" starting from the 12th index.\n\nThe character at index 12 is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' character in the string.\n2. Determine the character immediately following this 'w'.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The string is \"w1r1i1i0i1i0r1r1w1r\". Counting the characters, the rightmost 'w' is the 16th character in the string.\n2. To find the character immediately after the 16th 'w', we need to consider the length of the string minus one (since the position is 1-based index).\n\nThe string length is 18 characters (including the spaces). Therefore, the position of the character immediately after the 16th 'w' is 17.\n\nNow, let's check the 17th character in the string:\n\n- The characters in the string are: w, 1, r, 1, i, 1, i, 0, i, 1, i, 0, r, 1, r, w, 1, r.\n- The 17th character is 'r'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
