Extract the digit directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of 'w' in the string:\n\n```python\ncount_w = string.count('w')\n```\n\nThe position of the last 'w' is `count_w - 1` because string indices start at 0.\n\nNow, let's extract the digit directly to the right of this 'w'. We'll split the string at the last 'w' and take the second element (index 1) of the resulting list.\n\nHere's the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0r1i0i0i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0i0i1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i0r1r1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1i0r1i1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1w1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1w1\"\n\n# Find the position of the last 'w'\nlast_w_position = count_w - 1\n\n# Extract the digit to the right of the last 'w'\ndigit_after_w = string[input_string.index('w', last_w_position + 1)] if input_string.index('w', last_w_position + 1) != -1 else '0'  # Handle edge case where 'w' is at the end\n\n# Output the result\nanswer = <answer>digit_after_w</answer>"}
