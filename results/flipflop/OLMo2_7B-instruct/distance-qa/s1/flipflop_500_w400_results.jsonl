We can achieve this by iterating through the string from the end to the beginning and checking for the character 'w'.\n\nOnce we find the rightmost 'w', we look at the character immediately to its right. This can be done by indexing the string with the position of the 'w' minus 1 (since string indices start at 0).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the input string\ninput_string = \"w1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0i0i0i0r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0w0i0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0r0i0i0i1i1r0i0r0r0i0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1i0i1r0i0r0r0i0i1i0i1r0i0r0r1i0r1i0r1r1\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = len(input_string) - 1 - input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Get the character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w'\ncharacter_after_w = input_string[rightmost_w_index]\n\n# Output the result\nanswer = <answer> B </answer>"}

The rightmost 'w' is the last occurrence of 'w' in the string. We can achieve this by iterating through the string from the end to the beginning and checking for the character 'w'.\n\nOnce we find the rightmost 'w', we look at the character immediately to its right. This can be done by indexing the string with the position of the 'w' minus 1 (since string indices start at 0).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the input string\ninput_string = \"w1i1i0i0i0r1i1i0r1i0i1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i0r1i0i0r1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1r1w1i1i1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1i1r1i1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1i1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1r1w1i1i1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1i1r1i1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1i1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1r1\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = len(input_string) - 1 - input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Get the digit immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w'\ndigit_after_w = input_string[rightmost_w_index]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(digit_after_w) + \"</answer>"}
