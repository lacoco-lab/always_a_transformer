This can be done by summing the number of each character:\n\n- 'w': 1\n- '1': 5\n- 'i': 11\n- '0': 3\n- 'r': 10\n\nTotal characters = 1 + 5 + 11 + 3 + 10 = 30\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is the 30th character from the end of the string.\n\nTo find the digit immediately after the 'w', we need to consider the 31st character (since indexing starts at 0). However, the string provided does not have 31 characters. Therefore, we need to wrap around to the beginning of the string.\n\nThe 31st character from the end (considering wrapping around) is the first character 'w'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is the first digit of the number 'w1', which is '1'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}

Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w'. The string is structured with alternating characters and numbers, and the pattern seems to be:\n- 'w' followed by 'r' (wr)\n- 'r' followed by 'i' (ri)\n- 'i' followed by '0' (io)\n\nWe can count the occurrences of each pattern to find the position of the last 'w'.\n\nPattern 1: 'wr' (occurs 7 times)\nPattern 2: 'ri' (occurs 7 times)\nPattern 3: 'io' (occurs 8 times)\n\nThe total number of characters in the string is 81. Since the patterns repeat, we can calculate the position of the last 'w' by considering the total number of characters and the frequency of each pattern.\n\nLet's calculate the position of the last 'w':\n- The first 'w' appears at position 1 (since counting starts from 1).\n- Each 'wr' pattern adds 2 characters (w + r).\n- Each 'ri' pattern adds 2 characters (r + i).\n- Each 'io' pattern adds 3 characters (i + 0).\n\nThe total number of characters added by one complete cycle of the patterns is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{(wr)} + 2 \\text{(ri)} + 3 \\text{(io)} = 7 \\text{ characters} \\]\n\nThe number of complete cycles in 81 characters is:\n\\[ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{81}{7} \\right\\rfloor = 11 \\text{ complete cycles} \\]\n\nEach cycle contains 7 characters (from 'wr' and 'ri'), so after 11 cycles, we have:\n\\[ 11 \\times 7 = 77 \\text{ characters} \\]\n\nThis leaves us with:\n\\[ 81 - 77 = 4 \\text{ characters} \\]\n\nThe last 'w' must be the 77th character (since counting starts from 1), and the digit immediately after it will be the 78th character.\n\nLet's count the 78th character in the string:\n```\nInput: w1r1r1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i0r1i0r1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r</answer>", "flipflop": "w1r1r1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i0i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i1r1i0r1w1r1i0r1r1r1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i0r1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0r1r1i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i0r1i0r1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1r1i1r1i1i0i1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0r1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1", "last_valid_token": 1, "last_write_index": 200, "full_answer": "To determine the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' in the given string, we need to identify the position of the 'w' character and then look at the digit directly to its right.\n\nThe string is:\n```\nInput: w1r1r1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i0r1i0r1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1i0r1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i0r1i0r1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r\n```\n\nTo find the digit after the last 'w', we need to:\n1.
