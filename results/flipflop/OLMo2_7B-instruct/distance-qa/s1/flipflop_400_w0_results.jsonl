The string is composed of a mix of characters including 'w', 'r', 'i', and spaces. However, the pattern is not straightforward to predict without a clear repeating sequence.\n\nGiven the complexity and the length of the string, a direct algorithmic approach to find the 137th character without iterating through the string character by character would be computationally intensive and not practical here. Instead, we can use a more heuristic approach:\n\n1. **Estimate the length**: The string appears to have a repeating pattern of \"wrrir1r1\" followed by \"ir1r1\" and spaces. Let's estimate the length of one full cycle of this pattern.\n   - \"w\" -> 1 character\n   - \"r1r1\" -> 3 characters\n   - \"ir1r1\" -> 5 characters\n   - Total for one cycle: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 characters\n\n2. **Determine the position within the cycle**: \n   - 137 characters / 9 characters per cycle \u2248 15 cycles with a remainder of 8 characters.\n\n3. **Locate the character within the remainder**:\n   - The remainder (8 characters) suggests we look at the 8th character in the last cycle.\n\nGiven the string structure, the 8th character in the cycle \"ir1r1\" is 'r'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The character immediately to its right is at position 124.\n\nGiven the string is a long sequence of characters, we can determine the character at position 124 by examining the pattern and the length of the string. However, since the string is extremely long and the characters repeat in a pattern, we can infer that the character at position 124 will be the first character of the next repeating segment.\n\nThe repeating segment \"0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1\" has a length of 12 characters. The last 'w' in the string leads us to the start of this repeating segment.\n\nPosition 124 falls within the repeating segment \"0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1\". The 12th character in this segment is '0'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
