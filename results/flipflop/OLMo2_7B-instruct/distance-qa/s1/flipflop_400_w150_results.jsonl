Once we have identified the position of the 'w', we then check the digit immediately to its right.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from right to left (since we are looking for the rightmost 'w').\n3. Increment the position variable each time we encounter a 'w'.\n4. Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', get the character at that position.\n5. Convert the character to its corresponding digit (if it is a digit) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Initialize the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    rightmost_w_pos = -1\n    \n    # Iterate through the string from right to left\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            rightmost_w_pos = i\n            break\n    \n    # Get the character at the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    character = input_string[rightmost_w_pos]\n    \n    # Convert the character to its corresponding digit (if it is a digit)\n    if character.isdigit():\n        digit = int(character)\n    else:\n        digit = 0  # If it's not a digit, default to 0\n    \n    return digit\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1i0i0i1r1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0w1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r1i0r1i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i0r1i0i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0i0r1r1r1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0i1r\"\n\n# Find and print the digit after the rightmost 'w'\nanswer = \"<answer>B</answer>"}
