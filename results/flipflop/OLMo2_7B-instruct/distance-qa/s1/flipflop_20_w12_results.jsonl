The string is: \"w1r1r1r1i1i1w1i0i1r\"\n2. Find the position of the rightmost 'w':\n   - The string ends with 'r', so we start from the end and move backwards until we find 'w'.\n   - The rightmost 'w' is at position 13 (0-indexed).\n\n3. Determine the character at position 14 (since positions are 0-indexed):\n   - The character at position 14 is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
