Determine the character at that position.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput string: w1i0r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1i0i1i1i0i0i1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0i1r1r1i0i0i1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1i1r1i0i0i0r1i1i0r1r1i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0r1i0r1r1i1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0i1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1r1w0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at position 63.\n\nNow, let's determine the character at the 63rd position in the string:\n\nThe string is 128 characters long (including spaces and digits). To find the 63rd character, we need to consider the modulo operation with the length of the string:\n\n63 % 128 = 63 - (128 // 63) = 63 - 2 = 61\n\nSo, the 63rd character corresponds to the 61st position in the string.\n\nThe 61st character in the string is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
