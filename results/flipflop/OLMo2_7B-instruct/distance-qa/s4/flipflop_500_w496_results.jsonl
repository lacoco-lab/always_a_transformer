Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w'. The string is composed of several groups of characters, each group separated by 'r'. The last 'w' is part of the group starting with 'i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i0i0r1i0i1r1i1i0r1i1i0i0r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i0r1i0r1i0r1i0r1i0i1i0i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i0i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i1i1i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i0i0r1i1i0i1i1r1i0i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i1i1r1i0i0i1i1w0r'\n  \nThe last 'w' is the 65th character in the string (0-indexed).\n\nTo find the digit directly to the right of the 65th character, we need to consider the length of each group of characters separated by 'r'. Each group starts with 'i0r' and ends with 'i0r1'. The length of each group is 5 characters (including 'r').\n\nThus, the 65th character is the first character of the 13th group (since 65 / 5 = 13).\n\nThe characters in the 13th group are:\n```\ni0r1i0i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i0i0r1i0i1r1i1i0r1i1i0i0r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i0r1i0r1i0r1i0r1i0i1i0i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i0i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i1i1i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i1r1i0i0i1i1w0r\n```\n\nThe 65th character is 'i0', and the next character is 'r1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit directly to the right of the last 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
