The string is \"w0r0i1r0i1r0i0r0w1r\". Counting the positions starting from 0, the rightmost 'w' is at position 11.\n2. To find the character at position 12 (since positions are 0-indexed), we look at the 12th character in the string.\n\nThe 12th character in \"w0r0i1r0i1r0i0r0w1r\" is '1'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Counting the characters, the rightmost 'w' is the 16th character.\n2. To find the character immediately after the 16th 'w', we need to consider the length of the string and the positions of the other characters.\n\nThe string length is 16 characters. The positions of the characters are as follows:\n- 'w' at position 16\n- '1' at position 15\n- 'i' at positions 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (multiple 'i's occupy these positions)\n\nSince we are looking for the character immediately after the last 'w', we need to consider the next position, which is position 17.\n\nThe 17th position in the string is occupied by the character '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The rightmost 'w' is the last character of the string, which is 'r'.\n3. The position of the rightmost 'w' is 11 (0-indexed).\n\nNow, we need to find the character at position 12 (since positions are 0-indexed).\n\nThe string \"w1i0i1r1i0i1i0r1w1r\" has a length of 13 characters. Therefore, the character at position 12 is the first character of the next word, which is 'i'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
