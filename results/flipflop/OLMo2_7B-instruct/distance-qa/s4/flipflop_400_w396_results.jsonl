We need to identify the character at this position.\n\nBy examining the string, we see that the characters repeat in a pattern. The repeating unit is \"w0r1r1r1i0i1r1\". Let's find the position of the start of the next repeating unit after the last 'w':\n\n- The last 'w' is at position 63.\n- The repeating unit \"w0r1r1r1i0i1r1\" has a length of 8 characters.\n\nThe next repeating unit starts at position 63 + 8 = 71.\n\nNow, let's find the character at position 71:\n\n- The repeating unit \"w0r1r1r1i0i1r1\" starts with 'w', followed by '0', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', and 'i'.\n- Position 71 falls within the repeating unit after 'r1'.\n\nThus, the character at position 71 is 'i'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If it is 'w', update `lastPosition` to the current index.\n5. After the loop, `lastPosition` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n6. Convert `lastPosition` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    # Initialize the last position of 'w'\n    last_position = -1\n    \n    # Iterate from the end to the beginning of the string\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            last_position = i\n    \n    # Convert the position to the corresponding digit (0 or 1)\n    digit = str(last_position)\n    \n    # Return the digit\n    return <answer>digit</answer>"}

The string length is 128 characters (not including the space after the final 'r'). The 81st character corresponds to the 20th character in the range from 0 to 127 (since indexing starts at 0).\n\nGiven the string's structure, the 20th character is '0'. Therefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n4. After the loop, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n5. Convert `last_w_index` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    last_w_index = -1\n    for i, char in enumerate(input_string[::-1]):  # Iterate from the end to the beginning\n        if char == 'w':\n            last_w_index = i\n    return str(last_w_index + 1)  # Convert index to digit (0-indexed to 1-indexed)\n\ninput_string = \"w0i0r0r0r0i0i1r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1i1i1r0i0i0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1i0r0i0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1i1r0r0i1i0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i1i0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i0r0r0r0i0i1i0r0i1i0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i0i1r0i1i1r0i1r0r0i1w1r\"\n    result = find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string)\n    return <answer>{result}</answer>"}
