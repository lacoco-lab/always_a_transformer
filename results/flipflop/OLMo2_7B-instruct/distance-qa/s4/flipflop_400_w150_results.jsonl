Determine the digit immediately to the right of this 'w' character.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the 'w':\n\nInput string: w0r0i0i0i1i0r0r0i1i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0r0r0i0i1i1r0i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r0i0i1i1r0i0i1r0i0i1i1r0r0w0i1i0i1r0i1r0i1i0r0r0i1i0i1i0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0r0r0i1i0i1i0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i0r\n\nThe 'w' character appears at the 37th position in the string.\n\nNext, we need to find the digit immediately to the right of this 'w'. We will iterate through the string from the 36th position onward until we find a digit.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this task:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i0i0i1i0r0r0i1i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0r0r0i0i1i1r0i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0r0i0i0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r0i0i1i1r0i0i1r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0r0\"\n\nposition_of_w = input_string.find('w') + 1  # Adding 1 to get the position number starting from 1\n\n# Iterate from the position of 'w' to find the first digit\nfor i in range(position_of_w, len(input_string)):\n    if input_string[i].isdigit():\n        right_of_w_digit = input_string[i]\n        break\n\n# Output the result\nanswer = \"<answer>\" + right_of_w_digit + \"</answer>"}

Once we have identified the position of the last 'w', we can determine the digit immediately following it.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1 to keep track of the index of the last 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (to find the rightmost 'w').\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n4. After the loop, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n5.

Once we have identified the position of the last 'w', we can then determine the digit immediately following it.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from right to left (since we are looking for the rightmost 'w').\n3. Increment the position variable each time we encounter a 'w'.\n4. Once we have the position of the last 'w', determine the digit at that position in the string.\n5. Return the digit.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_last_w(input_string):\n    position_of_last_w = -1\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            position_of_last_w = i\n            break\n    if position_of_last_w != -1:\n        return str(input_string[position_of_last_w])\n    else:\n        return \"No 'w' found\"\n\ninput_string = \"w0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1r0i0r0r0i0i0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i1i0i1i1r0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0i1r0r0i1r0i1i0i0i1r0i0w0i0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i1r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i1i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i1i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i1i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i1i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0\"\n    \noutput = find_digit_after_last_w(input_string)\n<answer>B</answer>"}
