Identify the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n2. Determine the character at the position immediately after the rightmost 'w'.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. The string is \"w1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r\". Counting the characters, the rightmost 'w' is the 16th character.\n2. To find the character at the 17th position (since positions are 1-indexed), we need to consider the length of the string and the characters that follow the 'w'.\n\nThe string \"w1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r\" has 12 characters (including the spaces). Therefore, the 17th position is beyond the end of the string.\n\nSince there are no characters after the last 'r' in the string, the 17th position is outside the bounds of the string. In such cases, the standard convention is to consider the character as a null character ('\\0' or EOF in C), which is typically not displayed or considered part of the string.\n\nGiven this understanding, the character at the 17th position is a null character, which does not correspond to any of the provided options (A. 0 or B. 1).\n\nHowever, if we consider the problem in a different light, assuming the question intends to ask for the character immediately before the last 'r' (which would be the 16th character), we can proceed as follows:\n\nThe 16th character is 'r'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
