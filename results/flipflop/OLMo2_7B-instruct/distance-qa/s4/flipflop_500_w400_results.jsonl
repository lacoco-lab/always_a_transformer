Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of that 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w'. We'll count the number of 'w' characters and then find the position of the last one.\n\nThe string contains 24 occurrences of 'w'. The last 'w' is the 24th occurrence.\n\nTo find the digit directly to the right of the 24th 'w', we need to consider the length of the string minus one (since we're looking at the position immediately after the last 'w'). The string length is 255 characters.\n\nThus, the position of the digit directly to the right of the 24th 'w' is:\n```\n255 - 24 + 1 = 232\n```\n\nNow, we need to determine the character at index 232 in the string. However, since the string is zero-indexed, we actually need to consider index 231.\n\nLet's look at the 231st character in the string:\n```\nInput: w0i1r0i0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0i1i0i1r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i0i0r0r0i0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i1r0i0r0r0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i0w1r1r1i1i1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0i1r1i1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i1i0i0r1i0r1i1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1i0r\n```\n\nAt index 231, the character is '0'. Therefore, the digit directly after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
