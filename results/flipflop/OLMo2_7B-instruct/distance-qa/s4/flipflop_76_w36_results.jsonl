Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' character.\n2. Determine the character immediately after this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput string: w1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i0r1r1i1w1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r\n\n- The string is composed of alternating characters from 'w', 'i', 'r', and numbers.\n- The pattern repeats every 4 characters: 'wir1'.\n- The sequence 'wir1' is followed by a number.\n\nTo find the rightmost 'w':\n- The repeating pattern 'wir1' occupies 4 characters.\n- The entire string length is 37 characters.\n- The number of complete 'wir1' cycles in the string is \\( \\frac{37}{4} = 9 \\) complete cycles with a remainder of 1.\n- The remainder indicates that the rightmost 'w' is the first character of the 10th cycle.\n\nThe 10th cycle starts at position 9 * 4 + 1 = 37.\n\nNow, let's determine the character immediately after the rightmost 'w':\n- The 10th cycle starts with 'w'.\n- The next character after 'w' in the cycle is 'i'.\n\nThus, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is 'i'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}
