Determine the character at that position.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput string: w1i0i0i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1w1i1i1i0i0i0r1r1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i1i1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at position 81 (0-indexed).\n\nNow, let's find the character at position 81:\n\nThe string is composed of various characters, including digits (0-9), uppercase letters (A-Z), and lowercase letters (a-z). We need to determine the character at position 81 by examining the sequence of characters.\n\nGiven the complexity of the string and the mix of characters, a direct algorithmic approach would involve iterating through the string and accessing the character at the specified index. However, due to the length and complexity of the string, a more efficient approach would be to use a programming language to directly access the character at position 81.\n\nHere's a Python snippet to find the character:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"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</answer>"}

Once we identify the position of the 'w', we then determine the digit in that position.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `position` to 0 to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (since we are looking for the rightmost 'w').\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'.\n4. If the current character is 'w', increment the `position` variable.\n5. Once we find the rightmost 'w', the digit at that position is our answer.\n6. Convert the position to its corresponding digit and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    position = 0\n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            position += 1\n    return str(position)\n\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1w1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i1i0i1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w' position\nrightmost_w_position = find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string)\nanswer = \"<answer>\" + rightmost_w_position + \"</answer>"}
