To find the character immediately after the 16th 'w', we need to consider the length of the string and the positions of the characters.\n\nThe string length is 18 characters. Since the 16th character is a 'w', the 17th character is the next one.\n\nLet's count the characters in the string:\n- w1: 3 characters\n- i1i: 2 characters\n- 0: 1 character\n- i1r1: 3 characters\n- r1r1: 2 characters\n\nTotal characters = 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 11 characters before the last 'w'.\n\nAdding the 'w' itself, the 16th character is the 11th + 1 = 12th character from the start of the string.\n\nThe 17th character is the next one, which is 'r'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 'r'.\n\nThe answer is: <B> r </B></answer>"}

Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Determine the character at the position immediately after the rightmost 'w'.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The string is \"w0r0i0r0i0r0w0i0r0r\". To find the position of the rightmost 'w', we can iterate through the string from right to left until we find 'w'.\n\n2. Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', we can access the character at the next index.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i0r0i0r0w0i0r0r\"\nrightmost_w_index = len(input_string) - 1 - input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Check if there is a character at the rightmost_w_index\nif rightmost_w_index < len(input_string):\n    answer = input_string[rightmost_w_index]\nelse:\n    answer = ''\n\n# Output the answer\nanswer\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the answer. Let's execute it:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i0r0i0r0w0i0r0r\"\nrightmost_w_index = len(input_string) - 1 - input_string.rfind('w')\n\nif rightmost_w_index < len(input_string):\n    answer = input_string[rightmost_w_index]\nelse:\n    answer = ''\n\nprint(\"<answer>\" + answer + \"</answer>"}

Check the character immediately after this 'w'.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i0i0i0i1w1i0i0r\"\nright_most_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\nif right_most_w_index != -1:\n    next_character = input_string[right_most_w_index + 1]\n    answer = \"<answer>\" + str(next_character) + \"</answer>"}

Counting the positions from the right, the rightmost 'w' is at position 7.\n2. The next character after 'w' at position 7 is '1'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
