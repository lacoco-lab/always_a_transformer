Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\n- The string is composed of multiple groups of characters, each group separated by 'r'.\n- Each group contains a sequence of 'i' and 'r' characters.\n- The last 'w' is part of the final group.\n\nBy counting the 'r' separators, we can determine the number of groups before the final group containing 'w'. The final group contains the 'w' and the subsequent digit.\n\nLet's count the 'r' separators:\n\n- The first group: `w1r1i1r1r1i1i0` (5 'r' separators)\n- The second group: `r1i1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0` (7 'r' separators)\n- The third group: `r1r1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1i0` (8 'r' separators)\n- The fourth group: `r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0` (8 'r' separators)\n- The fifth group: `r1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0` (8 'r' separators)\n- The sixth group: `r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0` (10 'r' separators)\n\nThe final group containing 'w' starts after the 10th 'r'. This group consists of:\n- 'w'\n- '1'\n- 'r1'\n- 'r1'\n- 'i1'\n- 'r1'\n- 'i1'\n- 'i0'\n- 'r1'\n- 'i1'\n- 'r1'\n- 'i1'\n- 'i0'\n- 'r1'\n- 'i0'\n- 'r1'\n- 'i1'\n- 'i1'\n- 'r1'\n- 'i0'\n- 'r1'\n- 'i1'\n- 'i1'\n- 'r1'\n- 'i1'\n- 'i0'\n- 'r1'\n- 'i1'\n\nThis group has 23 characters, so the 'w' is the 22nd character from the start of the string.\n\nTo find the digit directly to the right of the 'w', we look at the 23rd character.\n\nThe 23rd character is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
