The string is composed of a mix of digits and characters, with the pattern repeating in a somewhat regular manner.\n\nGiven the length of the string (137 characters), we can determine that the repeating unit is 13 characters long (since 137 / 13 = 10 full repetitions with a remainder of 7).\n\nLet's analyze the 13-character repeating unit:\n```\nw1i0i0r1r1r1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1\n```\n\nThe last 'w' in the repeating unit is at the 13th position. Since our string has 7 extra characters after the last full repetition, we need to determine the character at the 113th position within the context of this repeating pattern.\n\nThe 113th character in the repeating unit falls at:\n- 13 * 10 (full repetitions) + 3 (position within the last repetition) = 123rd position in the repeating unit.\n\nThe 123rd character in the repeating unit is 'r1'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Since 'r' characters are consecutive and there are exactly 8 of them, position 35 corresponds to the second 'r' character.\n\nTherefore, the character at position 35 is 'r'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}

We need to find how many full patterns fit into 63 characters and the remainder:\n\n63 ÷ 4 = 15 full patterns with a remainder of 3.\n\nThe remainder tells us the position within the last full pattern. Since the pattern is (i, r, i, r), the 3rd position in this pattern is the second 'i'.\n\nThus, the character at position 63 is the second 'i'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}

The string length is 1000 characters. Since 'w' appears every 7 characters starting from position 7, the 997th character corresponds to the 7th position in the sequence of 'w' occurrences (since 997 mod 7 = 0).\n\nThe character at position 7 in the sequence of 'w' occurrences is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Determine the character at that position.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput string: w0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0i1i1r0i0i0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i0i0r0i0r0r0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i0r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0r0i0r0r0i0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1i1i0r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i0i1r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i0r0r0i1w1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at position 63.\n\nNow, let's determine the character at position 63:\n\nThe string is composed of various characters, including digits (0-9), uppercase letters (A-Z), and lowercase letters (a-z). To find the character at position 63, we need to consider the length of each type of character and their order in the string.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the string by character type and their counts:\n- Digits: 0 (1 occurrence)\n- Uppercase letters: A, R, O (4 occurrences)\n- Lowercase letters: w, o, i (3 occurrences)\n- Other characters: r, 1, 0, i (5 occurrences)\n\nThe total length of the string is 74 characters.\n\nGiven the distribution, the character at position 63 is most likely to be one of the digits (0-9) because the digits are less frequent and appear first in the sequence.\n\nSince position 63 falls within the range of digit occurrences (1 to 4), and given the uniform distribution of digits within their limited occurrences, the character at position 63 is most likely to be '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
