Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1 to keep track of the index of the last 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (to find the rightmost 'w').\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If it is 'w', update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n5. After the loop, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n6.

For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If it is 'w', update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n5. After iterating through the entire string, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n6. Convert `last_w_index` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    last_w_index = -1\n    for i, char in enumerate(input_string[::-1]):  # Iterate from the end to the beginning\n        if char == 'w':\n            last_w_index = i\n    return str(last_w_index + 1)  # Convert index to digit (0-indexed to 1-indexed)\n\ninput_string = \"w1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i0i1i1r1i0i0r1i0i1i0i0r1r1r1i0i1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i1i0r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0i1i0i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1i0i1i0r1r1i0i0i1r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i1i0r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0i1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i0r1r1i0i0i1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r</answer>"}

Extract the character at that position.\n\nThe string provided is:\n```\nw0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i1i0i1r0i0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0r0i0i1i1r0i1r0i0r0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0i1r0i1r0r0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i1i1r0i1r0i0r0i0r0r0i0i0r0r0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i1r0r0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0i0i0r0i1r0i1i1i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r0r0i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0i1r0r0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r0r0i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0r0r\n```\n\nBy examining the string, we can see that the rightmost 'w' is the 113th character from the start of the string.\n\nTo extract the character at the 113th position, we need to consider the length of the string and the character encoding (ASCII). However, given the complexity of the string and the potential for non-ASCII characters, a direct index calculation might not suffice. Instead, we can use Python to accurately determine and display the character.\n\nHere's the Python code to find the character at the 113th position:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i1i0i1r0i0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0r0i0i1i1r0i1r0i0r0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0i1r0i1r0r0i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i1i1r0i1r0i0r0i0r0r0i0i0i0r0i1r0i0i0r0i1r0i1i1i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r0r0i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0i0i0r0i1r0i1i1i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r0r0i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0i1r0r0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r0r0i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0r0r\"\n\ncharacter_at_113th_position = input_string[112]  # Adjust index to be 0-based\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(character_at_113th_position) + \"</answer>"}
