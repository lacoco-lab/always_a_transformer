The string is: \"w1r1r1r1w0r0r0i0i1r\"\n2. Find the position of the rightmost 'w':\n   - The 'w' characters are located at positions: 7, 13, and 19.\n   - The rightmost 'w' is at position 19.\n\n3. Determine the character at position 20 (since positions are 1-indexed):\n   - The character at position 20 is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
