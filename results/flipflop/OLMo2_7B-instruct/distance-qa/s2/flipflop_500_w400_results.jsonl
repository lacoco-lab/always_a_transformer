Therefore, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w'. The string is structured such that each 'r' is followed by an 'i' and then another 'r'. This pattern repeats until the end of the string.\n\nThe string ends with the 'w' character at the 101st position (counting the spaces as characters).\n\nTo find the digit immediately after the 'w', we look at the 102nd position in the string.\n\nThe 102nd character is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
