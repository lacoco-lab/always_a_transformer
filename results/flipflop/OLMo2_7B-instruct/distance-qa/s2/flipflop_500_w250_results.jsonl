Locate the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w'. The string is structured such that each 'r' is followed by one or more 'i's, and then by an 'r', and finally ending with 'w'. We can count the number of 'r's and 'i's until we reach the last 'w'.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Count the number of 'r' characters until we reach the last 'w'.\n2. The position of the last 'w' is the count of 'r' plus 1 (since 'w' is the character after the last 'r').\n3. The digit directly to the right of the last 'w' is the (position + 1)th digit in the string.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the input string\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0i1r1r1i0r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1i1i1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1i0i0i1r1i0i0i1r1i0i0i1r1i0i0i1r1i0i0i1r1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1i1i1i1r1i0i0i1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i0i1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i0i0r1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1i1r\"\n\n# Find the position of the last 'w'\nlast_w_position = len(input_string) - 1 - input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Extract the digit directly to the right of the last 'w'\ndigit_after_w = str(input_string[last_w_position + 1])\n\n# Output the result\nanswer = <answer>digit_after_w</answer>"}

We can achieve this by iterating through the string from the end to the beginning and checking for the character 'w'.\n\nOnce we find the rightmost 'w', we look at the character immediately to its right. This can be done by indexing the string with the position of the 'w' minus 1 (since string indices start at 0).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i0r1i0i0r1i1r1i1r1r1i1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i0i1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1i0i0r1i0i0r1i1i1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0i0r1i0i0r1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0i1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0i0i1r1i1w1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0r1i1i0r1i0r1i1r1i1r1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0r1i0i0r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1i1i1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i0r1i0r1i1i0i0i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i0i0r1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i1i1r1r1r1i1i0i1i1r1i1r1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0i0i1r\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = len(input_string) - 1 - input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Get the digit immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w'\ndigit_after_w = input_string[rightmost_w_index]\n\n# Output the result\nanswer = <answer>digit_after_w</answer>"}
