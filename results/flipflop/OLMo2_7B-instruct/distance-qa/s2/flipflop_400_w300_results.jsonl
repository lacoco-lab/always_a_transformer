The position of the last 'w' (15th 'w') is:\n132 - 15 = 117\n\nTo find the digit immediately after the 117th character, we need to consider the structure of the string. The string alternates between characters and numbers, and the numbers seem to increase sequentially.\n\nLet's break down the string into sections:\n- The first section: 'w1'\n- The second section: 'r1r1i0'\n- The third section: 'r1i1i1r1r1r1'\n- And so on...\n\nEach section seems to follow a pattern where:\n- The first character is 'w' or 'r'\n- The second character is a digit\n\nWe observe that the digits increase sequentially. To find the digit after the 117th character, we need to determine which section the 117th character falls into.\n\nLet's calculate the length of each section:\n- The first section ('w1') has 2 characters.\n- The second section ('r1r1i0') has 3 characters.\n- The third section ('r1i1i1r1r1r1') has 5 characters.\n\nThe pattern suggests that each subsequent section increases in length by 2 characters (from 2 to 3, then 3 to 5, etc.).\n\nTo find the section number containing the 117th character:\n117 / 2 = 58.5 (first full section)\n58 * 2 = 116 (characters in the first full section)\n\nSince 117 - 116 = 1, the 117th character falls into the next section.\n\nThe next section after the first full section (which is 3 characters long) starts at position 116 and ends at position 118:\n- Section 2 starts at position 116 and ends at position 118 (contains 'r1i1i1r1r1r1')\n\nThe 117th character is 'i1' in this section.\n\nThe digit immediately after 'i1' is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

To find the character at position 81, we need to consider the length of the pattern and determine the position within the pattern.\n\nThe pattern length is 3 characters (r, i, 0). To find the position within the pattern for the 81st character:\n\nPosition within pattern = (81 % 3) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the 81st character corresponds to the 2nd position in the pattern, which is 'i'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Once we have identified the position of the 'w', we then determine the digit immediately after it.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1 to keep track of the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (to find the rightmost 'w').\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If 'w' is found, update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n5. After the loop, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n6. Convert `last_w_index` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    last_w_index = -1\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            last_w_index = i\n    if last_w_index == -1:\n        return 'B'  # If no 'w' found, return B (as per the problem statement)\n    else:\n        return str(last_w_index + 1)  # Convert index to digit and return\n\ninput_string = \"w1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0r1i0r1r1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0i1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0i1r1r1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1i0w1i0i1r1r1i0i0i1r1i0i0i1r1r1i0i0i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i0r1i0i1i0r1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1\"\n\nresult = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\nprint(\"<answer>\" + result + \"</answer>"}

The 'w' character is the 15th character from the left.\n\nTo find the character immediately after the rightmost 'w', we need to determine the position of the 101st character in the string. Since the string has 15 'w' characters, the 101st character is the 86th character after the first 'w'.\n\nLet's count the characters from the first 'w' to the 86th character:\n- The first 'w' is at position 15.\n- The next 14 'w's are at positions 16 through 29.\n- The total for these 14 'w's is 14.\n\nAdding the position of the first 'w' (15) to the total positions of the 14 subsequent 'w's (14), we get:\n15 + 14 = 29\n\nSo, the 86th character is the 29th character after the first 'w'.\n\nNow, let's count the characters from the first 'w' to the 29th character:\n- The first 'w' is at position 15.\n- The next 14 characters are: i1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1i1i1i0r1i1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1 (80 characters)\n\nThe 29th character is the '0' in \"i0\".\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
