The string is \"w0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0i0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i0w0r\". Counting the characters, we see there are 21 characters in total.\n2. The rightmost 'w' is the 21st character.\n3. To find the character immediately after the 21st character, we need to consider the length of the string and the positions of the other characters.\n\nSince the string is 21 characters long, the position right after the 21st character is position 22. However, since strings are 0-indexed, position 22 corresponds to the 23rd character.\n\nThe characters in the string are:\n- w\n- 0\n- r\n- 0\n- r\n- 0\n- r\n- 0\n- i\n- 1\n- r\n- 0\n- r\n- 0\n- i\n- 0\n- i\n- 0\n- r\n- 0\n- i\n- 0\n- w\n\nThe 23rd character in this sequence is 'i'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
