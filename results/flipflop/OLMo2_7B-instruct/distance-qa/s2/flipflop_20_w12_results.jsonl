Counting the positions from the right, the rightmost 'w' is at position 7.\n2. To find the character at position 8 (since positions are 1-indexed in most programming languages), we look at the 8th character in the string.\n\nThe 8th character in \"w0r0i1r0r0i1w1i0i0r\" is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
