Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1 to keep track of the index of the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (to find the rightmost 'w').\n3.

For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n4. After the loop, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n5. Convert `last_w_index` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    last_w_index = -1\n    for i, char in enumerate(input_string[::-1]):  # Iterate from the end to the beginning\n        if char == 'w':\n            last_w_index = i\n    if last_w_index == -1:\n        return 'B'  # If no 'w' found, return B (indicating there's nothing after)\n    else:\n        return str(last_w_index)  # Convert index to digit and return\n\ninput_string = \"w0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1r0r0i0i0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0r0r0i0i0i1i0i1r0i0r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i1i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0i0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i0i0r0i1i1r0r0i1i0i1i1i0i1w0r\"\n    result = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\n    return <answer>{result}</answer>"}
