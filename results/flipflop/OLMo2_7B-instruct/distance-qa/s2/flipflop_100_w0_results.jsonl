Identify the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n2. Count the characters from the right of this 'w' until we find a space (' ') or the end of the string.\n3. Return the character at this position.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput: w0r0i1r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1r0i0r0i1r0i1r0i1i0i1r0r0i1i0r0r0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at position 32 (0-indexed).\n\nNow, we count the characters from position 32 to the end of the string:\n\n- From position 32 to 63: \"r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0r0i1i0i1r0i1r0i0r0i1r0i1r0i1i0i1r0r0i1i0r0r0\"\n- From position 64 to 95: \"r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0r0i1i0i1r0i1r0i0r0i1r0i1r0i1i0i1r0r0i1i0r0r0\"\n\nCounting these characters gives us a total of 32 characters.\n\nSince we are looking for the character at position 32 (which is 0-indexed), we need to consider the character at index 31 in the actual string (as indexing starts at 0).\n\nThe character at index 31 is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
