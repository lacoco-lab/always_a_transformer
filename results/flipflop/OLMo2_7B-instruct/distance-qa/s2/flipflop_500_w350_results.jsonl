Locate the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w'. The string is composed of alternating characters and numbers, with 'w' appearing in positions that follow a specific pattern. The pattern seems to be: 'w' after every 5 characters of the sequence 'r1r1r1i1'.\n\nLet's count the number of 'r1r1r1i1' sequences to find the position of the last 'w':\n- The first 'r1r1r1i1' sequence is from 'w1' to 'i1'.\n- The second 'r1r1r1i1' sequence is from 'i1r1i1r1' to 'i1r1i1i0'.\n- The third 'r1r1r1i1' sequence is from 'i1r1i1r1i0' to 'i1r1i1i0r1'.\n- The fourth 'r1r1r1i1' sequence is from 'i1r1i1i0r1' to 'i1r1i1i0i1'.\n- The fifth 'r1r1r1i1' sequence is from 'i1r1i1i0i1' to 'i1r1i1i0i1r1'.\n\nCounting these sequences, we find there are 5 sequences. Therefore, the last 'w' is at position 5 + 1 = 6 (since positions are 1-indexed).\n\nNow, let's look at the digit directly to the right of the last 'w'. In the string, the character at position 6 is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
