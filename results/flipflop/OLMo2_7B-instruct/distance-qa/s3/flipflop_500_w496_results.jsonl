Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w'. The string is structured with alternating characters '1' and 'r' before and after each 'w'. \n\nThe pattern repeats as follows:\n- 'w' is followed by '1', then 'r', then '1', then 'r', and so on.\n\nTo find the position of the last 'w':\n- The first 'w' appears at position 7 (counting from 0).\n- Each subsequent 'w' is preceded by 2 '1's and 1 'r', so the position of the nth 'w' can be calculated as: `7 + 2*(n-1)`.\n- We need to find the position of the last 'w', which is the 21st 'w' (since 'w' appears 21 times).\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Position of 21st 'w'} = 7 + 2*(21-1) = 7 + 40 = 47 \\]\n\nNow, we look at the digit directly to the right of the 47th 'w'. The string ends at position 81, so the 47th 'w' is the last 'w' in the string.\n\nThe digit directly to the right of the 47th 'w' is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
