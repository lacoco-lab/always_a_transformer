The last complete pattern before the end of the string is:\n- 'w', 'i', '0', 'r', ' '\n\nThis pattern ends at the 5th character from the start.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is the last character of this pattern, which is the 5th character from the start of the string.\n\nNow, let's look at the character immediately after the rightmost 'w':\n- The 5th character is 'w'.\n- The 6th character is 'i'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 'i', which corresponds to option B.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
