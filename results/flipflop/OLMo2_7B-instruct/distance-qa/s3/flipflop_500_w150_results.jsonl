Each group is separated by 'r', and the last 'w' will be at the end of the last group.\n\nLet's count the groups and find the position of the last 'w':\n\n```plaintext\nGroup 1: w1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1i1i1r1i0i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0i1i0r1w1r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0r1r1i1i0i0i0r1r1r1i1r1i1i0i0i0r1r1r1i0i0i0r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1i1r1i1r\n```\n\nThere are 24 groups separated by 'r'. The last 'w' is at the end of the 24th group.\n\nTo find the digit directly to the right of the last 'w', we look at the 25th character in the string (since positions are 1-indexed).\n\nLet's count the characters in the 24th group to ensure we're looking at the right place:\n\n- The 24th group starts with 'r' and ends with 'i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1i1i1r1i0i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0i1i0r1w1r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0r1r1i1i0i0i0r1r1r1i1r1i1i0i0i0r1r1r1i0i0i0r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1i1r1i1r\n\nThe 25th character is '0'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n<answer>0</answer>"}
