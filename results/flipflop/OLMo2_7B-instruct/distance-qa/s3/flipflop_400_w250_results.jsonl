Count the number of complete cycles.\n2. Determine the position of the last 'w' within the last cycle.\n\nLet's count the cycles:\n- The first cycle: 'w'\n- The second cycle: 'r', 'i'\n- The third cycle: 'w', 'r', 'i'\n- The fourth cycle: 'r', 'i', 'w'\n- The fifth cycle: 'r', 'i', 'w', 'r'\n- The sixth cycle: 'i', 'w', 'r', 'i'\n- The seventh cycle: 'i', 'w', 'r', 'i', 'w'\n- The eighth cycle: 'r', 'i', 'w', 'r', 'i'\n- The ninth cycle: 'r', 'i', 'w', 'r', 'i', 'w'\n- The tenth cycle: 'i', 'w', 'r', 'i', 'w', 'r'\n- The eleventh cycle: 'i', 'w', 'r', 'i', 'w', 'r', 'i'\n- The twelfth cycle: 'w', 'r', 'i', 'w'\n\nThe twelfth cycle ends with 'w'. Since each cycle is 3 characters long, the position of the last 'w' in the twelfth cycle is:\n12 * 3 = 36\n\nNow, we look at the character directly after position 36 in the string.

Once we have identified the position of the 'w', we then check the digit immediately to its right.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from right to left (since we are looking for the rightmost 'w').\n3. Increment the position variable each time we encounter a 'w'.\n4. Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', get the character at that position.\n5. Convert the character to its corresponding digit (if it is a digit) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Initialize the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    rightmost_w_pos = -1\n    \n    # Iterate through the string from right to left\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            rightmost_w_pos = i\n            break\n    \n    # Get the character at the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    character = input_string[rightmost_w_pos]\n    \n    # Convert the character to its corresponding digit (if it is a digit)\n    if character.isdigit():\n        digit = int(character)\n    else:\n        digit = 0  # If it's not a digit, default to 0\n    \n    return digit\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1r1i0i1i1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1i1i1i0i0r1r1i1i0i1i1i1r1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1i0i1r1i1i0r1r1i1i0r1i1i0r1i1r1i0i1r1i1r1r1w1i0r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1\"\n\n# Find the digit after the rightmost 'w'\nanswer = \"<answer>B</answer>"}

Once we have the position, we can determine the digit immediately after it.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from right to left (since we are looking for the rightmost 'w').\n3. Increment the position variable each time we encounter a 'w'.\n4. Once we find the rightmost 'w', determine the digit at the position immediately after it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0r0r0r0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0r0i0r0i1i0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1r0r0i0i1r0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i0r0w1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1i0i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1i0i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1\"\n\nposition_of_last_w = -1\n\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        position_of_last_w = len(input_string) - 1 - (position_of_last_w + 1)\n        break\n\nif position_of_last_w != -1:\n    digit_after_w = str(input_string[position_of_last_w])\n    answer = \"<answer>B</answer>"}
