Find the position of the rightmost 'w':\n   - The string ends with 'r', so we need to count the characters from the end of the string backwards until we find 'w'.\n   - The characters from the end: 'r', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', 'i', '0', 'r'\n   - The position of the last 'w' is 7 (counting from the end).\n\n3. Determine the character immediately following the rightmost 'w':\n   - The 8th position in the string is 'i'.\n   - Therefore, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is 'i'.\n\nUsing the provided format, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
