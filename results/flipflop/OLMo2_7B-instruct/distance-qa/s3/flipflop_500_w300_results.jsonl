Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w'. The string is structured with alternating characters, starting with 'w', followed by 'r', then 'i', and so on. We can count the occurrences of each character to find the position of the last 'w'.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the string:\n- 'w': 3 occurrences\n- 'r': 4 occurrences\n- 'i': 5 occurrences\n- '0': 6 occurrences\n- ' ': 7 occurrences\n\nThe pattern repeats every 16 characters (w, r, i, 0, space). The last 'w' will be at position 3 within each cycle of 16 characters.\n\nSince the entire string is 55 characters long, we need to determine how many full cycles of 16 characters fit into 55 characters and where the last 'w' falls within the remaining characters.\n\n55 characters / 16 characters per cycle = 3 full cycles with a remainder of 11 characters.\n\nIn the 3 full cycles:\n- The last 'w' in the first cycle is at position 3.\n- The last 'w' in the second cycle is at position 3 + 16 = 19 (which is beyond the string length).\n\nThe remainder of 11 characters includes:\n- 1 '0'\n- 1 'r'\n- 1 'i'\n- 1 ' '\n- 5 '0's\n\nThe last 'w' falls at position 3 within this remainder.\n\nThe digit directly to the right of the last 'w' is at position 4.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
