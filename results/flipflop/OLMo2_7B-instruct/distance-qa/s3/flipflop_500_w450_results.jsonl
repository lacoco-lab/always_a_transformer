Here, I'll use a straightforward iteration:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1, indicating that we haven't found the last 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the beginning to the end.\n3. If the current character is 'w', update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n4. After the iteration, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the last 'w'.\n5. The digit immediately after the last 'w' is the character at `last_w_index + 1`.\n\nLet's perform this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1i0i1i0r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0i0r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1i0r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1w1i0i1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i0i1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1i0r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1\"\n\nlast_w_index = -1\nfor char in input_string:\n    if char == 'w':\n        last_w_index = len(input_string) - 1 - index  # Adjust for zero-based indexing\n        break\n\n# The digit immediately after the last 'w' is the character at last_w_index + 1\ndigit_after_w = input_string[last_w_index + 1]\nanswer = <answer> B </answer>"}

The rightmost 'w' is the last occurrence of 'w' in the string. We can achieve this by iterating through the string from the end to the beginning and checking for the character 'w'.\n\nOnce we find the rightmost 'w', we look at the character immediately to its right. This can be done by indexing the string with the position of the 'w' minus 1 (since string indices start at 0).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the input string\ninput_string = \"w1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1r1i1i0i0r1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i0i1i0i0r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i0i1i1r1i1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0r1i1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1i0i1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1i0r1i1i0i1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1i1i1r1i1r1i1i0i0r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i1i0r1i1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1w1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1r1i0r\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = len(input_string) - 1 - input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Get the character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w'\ncharacter_to_right = input_string[rightmost_w_index]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(character_to_right) + \"</answer>"}

We can achieve this by iterating through the string from the end to the beginning and checking for the character 'w'.\n\nOnce we find the rightmost 'w', we look at the character immediately to its right. This can be done by indexing the string with the position of the 'w' minus 1 (since string indices start at 0).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the input string\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i0r1i0i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0i1r1i0i0i1r1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1i0i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i0i0r1i1i1i1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1i1i0r1i1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i0i1i1r1i1i1r1i0r1i1i1i0i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i0r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i0i1r1i0i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1r1i0i0w1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r\"\n  \n# Find the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Check if 'w' was found and get the character immediately to its right\nif rightmost_w_index != -1:\n    rightmost_w_character_index = rightmost_w_index - 1\n    rightmost_character = input_string[rightmost_w_character_index]\n    answer = f\"<answer>{rightmost_character}</answer>"}

We can achieve this by iterating through the string from the end to the beginning and checking for the character 'w'.\n\nOnce we find the rightmost 'w', we look at the character immediately to its right. This can be done by indexing the string with the position of the 'w' minus 1 (since string indices start at 0).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the input string\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i0r1i0i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0i0i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i0i1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0i0r1i0i1r1r1i1r1r1r1w1r1i0i1i0i1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = len(input_string) - 1 - input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Get the character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w'\ncharacter_to_right = input_string[rightmost_w_index]\n\n# Output the result\nanswer = \"<answer>\" + str(character_to_right) + \"</answer>"}
