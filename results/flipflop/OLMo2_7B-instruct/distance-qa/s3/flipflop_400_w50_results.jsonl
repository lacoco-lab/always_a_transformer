To accurately determine the character at position 113, we need to consider the length of each type of character sequence and their order.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the string by character type and their counts:\n- 'w': 1\n- '1': 8\n- 'r': 15\n- 'i': 18\n- '0': 10\n- Other characters: 0\n\nSince 'w' appears only once and is the last character in the sequence, it is at position 1 within its own group. The next character after 'w' will be the first character of the next group.\n\nThe next group starts with '1' and has 8 occurrences. Therefore, the character at position 113 (which is the 1st position within the '1' group) is '1'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Once we have identified the position of the 'w', we then check the digit in that position.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `lastPosition` to keep track of the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (to find the rightmost 'w').\n3. If the current character is 'w', update `lastPosition` to the current position.\n4. After the loop, `lastPosition` will hold the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n5. Convert `lastPosition` to its corresponding digit (since it's a zero-indexed position).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1r1i0i1r1r1i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i0r1w1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i0i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i1r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i0i1i0i0r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w'\nlast_w_position = -1\nfor i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n    if input_string[i] == 'w':\n        last_w_position = i\n        break\n\n# Convert the position to the corresponding digit (0-indexed)\ndigit_at_right_most_w = str(last_w_position)\n\n# Output the answer\nanswer = <answer>digit_at_right_most_w</answer>"}

Once we have identified the position of the 'w', we then check the character immediately to its right.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1 to keep track of the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (to find the rightmost 'w').\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If 'w' is found, update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n5. After the loop, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n6.
