Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Determine the character at that position.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput string: w0r0r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0w0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i0i0i1i0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at position 63 (counting from 0).\n\nNow, let's determine the character at position 63:\n\nThe string is composed of various characters, including digits (0-9), uppercase letters (A-Z), and lowercase letters (a-z). To find the character at position 63, we need to consider the length of each type of character and their order in the string.\n\nHere's the breakdown of character types and their counts:\n- Digits: 0 (at positions 0-9)\n- Uppercase letters: 10 (A-Z)\n- Lowercase letters: 10 (a-z)\n- Other characters: 21 (i, r, o, etc.)\n\nThe total number of characters is 75.\n\nDigits occupy 10 positions (0-9), leaving 65 positions for uppercase and lowercase letters, and other characters.\n\nGiven that uppercase letters and lowercase letters are equally distributed (10 each), and there are 21 other characters, we can calculate the distribution within the remaining 65 positions:\n\n- Uppercase letters: (65 / 2) * 10 = 325 / 2 = 162.5 (round down to 162, as we can't have half a character)\n- Lowercase letters: 65 - 162 = -97 (This indicates an error in the initial assumption; let's correct it by considering the actual distribution)\n\nSince the initial assumption was incorrect, let's correct it by considering the actual distribution:\n\n- Uppercase letters: 32 (since 10 * 3 = 30 for the first three letters [A, B, C], and 2 more for D and E, leaving 3 unused positions)\n- Lowercase letters: 33 (since 10 * 3 = 30 for the first three letters [a, b, c], and 3 more for d, e, f)\n\nThis leaves 65 - 32 - 33 = 0 positions for other characters after the first 65 characters.\n\nGiven this correction, the character at position 63 is an uppercase letter since we have exhausted all other character types before reaching position 63.\n\nThe uppercase letters in the string are: A, B, C, D, E, F\n\nThus, the character at position 63 is 'E'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Once we have identified the position of the 'w', we then determine the digit immediately after it.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1 to keep track of the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (to find the rightmost 'w').\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If it is 'w', update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n5. After the loop, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n6.
