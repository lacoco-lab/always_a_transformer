The string length is 255 characters (as determined by the repeated pattern \"r0\" which appears 255 times).\n\nThe 113th character corresponds to the 63rd byte (since 113 / 2 = 56.5, and we take the ceiling to account for the half-byte, but in practice, we use integer division and add 1).\n\nGiven the string is encoded in UTF-8, which is a variable-length encoding, the 63rd byte will actually correspond to the 62nd to 70th Unicode code unit (since each UTF-8 character can be 1 to 4 bytes).\n\nHowever, since the string is composed of repeated \"r0\" and occasional \"i\" characters, and considering the length, the 113th character is likely to be one of the \"i\" characters due to the pattern.\n\nLet's confirm this programmatically:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0i1i0i0i1r0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0i1i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0r0i0r0r0i0i1i1i1r0r0i1r0i1r0i1i0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1r0r0i1r0i1r0i1i0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i0i1r0i0r0r0i0i0r0i1i1r0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r\"\n\n# Find the index of the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Extract the character at the rightmost 'w' index\ncharacter_at_rightmost_w = input_string[rightmost_w_index]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(character_at_rightmost_w) + \"</answer>"}

Initialize a counter `count` to 0.\n3. While `i` is not equal to -1 (the index of the first character):\n   - If the character at index `i` is 'w':\n     - Increment `count` by 1.\n     - Move `i` to the left by 1 (i.e., `i = i - 1`).\n   - Otherwise, move `i` to the right by 1 (i.e., `i = string.length() + 1`).\n4. The digit we are looking for is at index `i` in the string.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0r0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0r0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i1i0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i1i0i1i0i0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0r0r0r0i0i1i0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0i0i0i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1r\"\n\n# Find the index of the first 'w'\ni = len(input_string) - 1\nwhile i >= 0 and input_string[i] != 'w':\n    i -= 1\n\n# Count the number of characters from the 'w' to the end\ncount = i + 1\n\n# The digit after the rightmost 'w' is at index 'count'\ndigit = input_string[count]\n\n# Output the answer\nanswer = <answer>B</answer>"}

Initialize a variable to keep track of the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from right to left (since we are looking for the rightmost 'w').\n3. Increment the position variable each time we encounter a 'w'.\n4. Once we have the position of the last 'w', determine the digit at that position in the original string.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0i1i1i0r1i0i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1i1r1i0i1r1r1i0i0r1r1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1i0r1i1i0r1r1i0r1i1i0r1r1i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0</answer>"}
