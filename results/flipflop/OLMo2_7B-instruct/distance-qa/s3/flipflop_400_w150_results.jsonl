Once we have identified the position of the last 'w', we can then determine the digit immediately following it.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1 to keep track of the index of the last 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (since we are looking for the rightmost 'w').\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If the character is 'w', update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n5. After the loop, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n6. Convert `last_w_index` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_last_w(input_string):\n    last_w_index = -1\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            last_w_index = i\n    return str(last_w_index + 1)  # +1 to convert index to actual digit\n\ninput_string = \"w0r0i1i1i0r0i1r0i0i0r0i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i1i0i1r0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i0i1i1r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1i1i1i0r0i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i0i1w0r0r0i0i0r0i0r0i0i1i1r0r0r0r0i0i0i1r0r0r0r0i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i1i1i1i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i1i0i1r0i0r0i0i1r0r0i0r0i0i0r0r0i0i1r0i1i1r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0r0i0i1r0i1i0i0r0i1i1r\"\n\nanswer = find_digit_after_last_w(input_string)\nprint(\"<answer>\" + answer + \"</answer>"}

We need to ensure that the character at position 113 is a digit.\n\nLet's extract the character at position 113:\n\n```plaintext\nInput: w0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i1i0i0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i0i0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0i1i1i1r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i1i1r0i1r0i1i0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0w0i1i0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0r0i0i1r0i0i0r0r0i1i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0i0r0i0i0r0r0i1i1r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1r0r0i1i0i0r0i0r\n```\n\nAt position 113, the character is '0'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
