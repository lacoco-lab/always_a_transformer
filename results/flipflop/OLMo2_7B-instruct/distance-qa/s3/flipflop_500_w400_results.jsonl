Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w'. The string is structured with alternating characters and numbers, and the pattern repeats several times. The repeating pattern is:\n```\nw1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1i0\n```\n\nEach full cycle of this pattern is 11 characters long:\n```\nw1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1i0\n```\n\nTo find the position of the last 'w', we need to determine how many full cycles fit into the string and then find the position of the last 'w' within the last cycle.\n\nThe string length is 81 characters. Dividing 81 by the length of one cycle (11) gives us 7 full cycles and a remainder of 4 characters.\n\nThe last 'w' will be in the 8th position of the 7th cycle.\n\nNow, let's extract the 7th cycle and find the digit immediately to the right of the last 'w':\n```\nw1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1i0\n```\n\nThe 7th cycle is:\n```\nw1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1i0\n```\n\nThe last 'w' is the 8th character in this cycle. The digit immediately to its right is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Look at the character directly to the right of the last 'w'.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of 'w' in the string:\n- The first 'w' is at position 12.\n- The second 'w' is at position 21.\n- The third 'w' is at position 30.\n- The fourth 'w' is at position 39.\n- The fifth 'w' is at position 48.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at position 48. The character directly to its right is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
