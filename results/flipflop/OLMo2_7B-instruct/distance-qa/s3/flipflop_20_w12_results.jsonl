Counting the characters, the rightmost 'w' is the 16th character.\n2. To find the character at the 17th position, we need to consider the length of the string and the positions of the characters within it.\n\nSince the string is padded with spaces to maintain a consistent length, we need to account for these spaces. The actual length of the meaningful characters (w, r, i) is 10.\n\nTherefore, the 17th position is actually the first position of the next set of characters after the last 'r'. The next set starts with 'i', so the 17th character is 'i'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
