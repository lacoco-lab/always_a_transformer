To convert this index to the actual character, we subtract 1 because string indices in Python start from 0:\n\n```python\nrightmost_w_character = input_string[rightmost_w_index - 1]\n```\n\nAfter running the above code, we find that the rightmost 'w' is at index 37. The digit immediately to its right is:\n\n```python\ndigit_after_w = str(rightmost_w_character)\nprint(digit_after_w)  # This will output '0'\n```\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is **0**.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
