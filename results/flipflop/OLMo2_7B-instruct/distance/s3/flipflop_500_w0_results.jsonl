Return the digit at the position indicated by the counter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i1r0r0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0r0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i0r0r0i0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i1r0i1r0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r</answer>"}
