The string contains a repeating pattern of 'w', '1', 'r', '1', and 'i' characters.\n\n2. **Determine the length of one pattern**: The pattern \"w1r1i1\" has a length of 4 characters.\n\n3. **Find the position of the last 'w'**: We need to find the position of the rightmost 'w' in the string. This can be done by iterating through the string from the end to the beginning and counting the occurrences of 'w'.\n\n4. **Calculate the position of the required digit**: Once we have the position of the last 'w', we calculate the position of the digit immediately after it by adding 1 to the position of the 'w'.\n\n5. **Extract the digit**: Retrieve the character at the calculated position.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_last_w(input_string):\n    # Find the position of the last 'w' from the end of the string\n    last_w_position = input_string.rfind('w')\n    \n    # If there is no 'w' at the end, return -1\n    if last_w_position == -1:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Calculate the position of the digit after the last 'w'\n    digit_position = last_w_position + 1\n    \n    # Extract the digit\n    digit = input_string[digit_position]\n    \n    return digit\n\n# Input string\ninput_string = \"w1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1i1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1i0r1i0i1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1i1i1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1\"\n\n# Execute the function\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_last_w(input_string)\n<answer></answer>"}
