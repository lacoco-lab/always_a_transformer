Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. When 'w' is encountered, check if `index` is equal to `w` (since we need the digit after the **rightmost** 'w').\n5. If `index` equals `w`, convert the character at that position to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0i1r0i0r0r0w0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w' and get the digit after it\nrightmost_w_index = len(input_string) - 1\noutput_digit = input_string[rightmost_w_index]\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
