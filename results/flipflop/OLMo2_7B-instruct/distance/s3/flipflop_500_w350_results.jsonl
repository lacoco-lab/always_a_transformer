Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, if it is 'w', increment the counter.\n4. When the character is not 'w', print the digit in the counter and reset the counter to 0.\n5. Continue this process until all characters in the string have been checked.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    counter = 0\n    result = \"\"\n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            counter += 1\n        elif counter == 0:\n            result = str(counter)\n            counter = 0\n        else:\n            counter = 0\n    return result\n\ninput_string = \"w0i1i0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i1i0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0i1r0i1r0r0i0i1r0i1i1r0i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0i0i1i0r0i0r0r0i1r0i0r0i1r0i0i1i1i1r0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0r0r0i1i1i0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1r0i0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i1i0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0i1w0r0i0i0r0r0i0i0i0r0i0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0i0r0i1i0i0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1i0i0i1r0i0r0i1i0i1r0i0r0i0r0i0i1r0i1i0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0r\"\n    \n    output_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string)\n    result = \"<answer>\" + output_digit + \"</answer>"}
