Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment the counter.\n4. When the rightmost 'w' is found, stop the iteration.\n5. Return the value of the counter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1i0i0i0i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i0i1r1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1w0r0i0i1r0i1i0i1i0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r\"\n\n# Initialize counter\ncounter = 0\n\n# Iterate from the rightmost character\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        counter += 1\n        break\n\n# Output the digit\noutput_digit = str(counter)\nprint(\"<answer>\" + output_digit + \"</answer>"}
