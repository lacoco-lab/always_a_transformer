Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of 'w' characters encountered.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (to find the rightmost 'w').\n3. Increment `count` each time a 'w' is found.\n4. When the loop completes without finding another 'w', the current value of `count` will be the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n5. Return the digit at the position `count`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i1i1r0i1r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1i1r0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i0i0i1i0r0r0i0w0i1i1i1r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i0i1r0r0i1i1i1r0i0i1r0i1r0r0i1i1i1i1i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0r0i1i0r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0i0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1i1r0i0i1r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i1i1i1i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0r0i1i0r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0r0</answer>"}

Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of 'w' characters encountered.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (to find the rightmost 'w').\n3. Increment `count` each time a 'w' is found.\n4. When the loop completes without finding another 'w', the current value of `count` will be the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n5. Return the digit at the position `count`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i0i0r0i1r0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0i1i1r0i0i1i1i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0i1i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i0r0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i0w0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0r0i1i1r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0i0r0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0i0r0r0i0i0i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0r0r0i1i1i0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1</answer>"}

Initialize a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string from the beginning to the end.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment the `index`.\n4. Once the loop completes, `index` will hold the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n5. Convert the `index` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i1i0i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i0r1i1i1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i1w1r1i0r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1r1i0i1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1r1i0i0r1i1i0i1r1i0r1i1i1r1i1i0i1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i1i0i0r1i0r1i1i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1r1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1i0i1r1i1i0r1r1r\"\n\nindex = 0\nfor char in input_string:\n    if char == 'w':\n        index += 1\n    if index > len(input_string):  # Exit loop if 'w' is not found\n        break\n\n# Convert index to digit and return\nanswer = str(index + 1) if index % 2 == 0 else str(index)  # 0-indexed position -> 1-indexed digit\nprint(\"<answer>\" + answer + \"</answer>"}
