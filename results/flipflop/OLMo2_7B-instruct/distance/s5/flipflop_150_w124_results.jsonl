Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment the counter.\n4. When the character is not 'w', print the digit corresponding to the current counter value and reset the counter to 0.\n5. Continue this process until all characters in the string have been processed.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0i1i1i1r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r0r0i1r0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0r0i0i1r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i0i0r0r0w1i1r1i1r1i1i1i0i1r1r1r1r\"\n\ncounter = 0\noutput_digit = \"\"\n\nfor char in reversed(input_string):  # Reversing to start from the rightmost character\n    if char == 'w':\n        counter += 1\n    else:\n        output_digit += str(counter)\n        counter = 0\n\noutput_answer = \"<answer>\" + output_digit + \"</answer>"}
