Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. Increment the counter for each 'r' character encountered.\n4. When the counter equals 'w', record the current position.\n5. Return the digit at the recorded position.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string, w):\n    counter = 0\n    position = -1\n    \n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'r':\n            counter += 1\n        if counter == w:\n            position = len(input_string) - 1 - counter\n    return str(position + 1)  # +1 to convert 0-based index to 1-based index\n\n# Given input\ninput_string = \"w1r1i1r1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0r1r1i1i1i0r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1i1i1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1i1r1r1i1w0r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i0i1i1r0r0r0i1r0i0i1r0i0r0i1i0i0r\"\n    w = 5  # Given 'w' value\n\n    # Find and print the digit after the rightmost 'w' character\n    result = find_digit_after_w(input_string, w)\n    print(\"<answer>\" + result + \"</answer>"}
