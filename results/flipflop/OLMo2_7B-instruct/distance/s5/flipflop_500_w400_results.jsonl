Continue this process until all characters in the string have been checked.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i1r0i0i1i1i1r0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1r0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i1i1i1i0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1i1i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i0w0r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i1i0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0i1r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i0w0r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i1i0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i0w0r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i1i0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i0w0r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i1i0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i0w0r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i1i0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i0w0r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i1i0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0i1r</answer>"}

Continue this process until the entire string has been iterated.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i0i0i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1i1i0i0r1i1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i0r1i1i0r1i1r1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i0i0r1i0i1i1i0r1r1i1i1r1i1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1i1i1r1i1r1i1w1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1r1i0i0r1r1r1i0r1i1r\"\n\ncounter = 0\noutput_digit = <answer>\n\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        counter += 1\n    else:\n        output_digit = str(counter)\n        break\n\nprint(output_digit)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the digit after the **rightmost** 'w' character in the input string.
