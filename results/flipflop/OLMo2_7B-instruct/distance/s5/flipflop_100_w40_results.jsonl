Continue this process until the entire string has been processed.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\nInput: w1r1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i1r1i1r1w1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n- Start from the right: '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1' -> Counter: 0 (since the first character is 'w')\n\n- Next character: 'w', increment counter: 1 -> Counter: 1\n\n- Next character: '1', increment counter: 2 -> Counter: 2\n\n- Next character: 'r', print counter (2) and reset counter: 0\n\n- Continue this process...\n\nAfter processing the entire string, the final output digit is:\n\n<answer>2</answer>"}

Iterate through the string starting from the character immediately after the last 'w' until the end of the string.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. Once 'w' is encountered again, the position `index` will be the position of the digit we are looking for, counting from the right.\n5. Convert the `index` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    # Find the last 'w' in the string\n    last_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n    \n    # Iterate from the position after the last 'w' to the end\n    for i in range(last_w_index + 1, len(input_string)):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            # Found another 'w', so the current index is the position after the rightmost 'w'\n            break\n    \n    # Convert the index to the corresponding digit\n    digit = str(last_w_index + 1) if last_w_index + 1 < len(input_string) else '0'\n    \n    return digit\n\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1i0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i1i1r0r0w0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0i1r0i1i0i1i1r0i1i1i1r0r0i0i1r0i0r0r0i0r\"\noutput = find_digit_after_w(input_string)\n<answer>1</answer>"}

Once the counter equals 'w', print the digit at the current position.\n5. Reset the counter and continue iterating until the end of the string.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0i1i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0i1r0i0i0r0i1i0i1w1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1i0i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize counter = 0.\n2. Start iterating from the last character: 'r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1'.\n3. Find the first 'w': 'w1' at position 16.\n   - Increment counter = 1.\n4. Find the next 'w': 'w1' at position 15.\n   - Increment counter = 2.\n5. Find the next 'w': 'w1' at position 14.\n   - Increment counter = 3.\n6. Counter now equals 'w' (3), so print the digit at position 14: '0'.\n7. Reset counter = 0.\n8. Continue iterating: 'r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0i1r0i0i0r0i1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1i0i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r'.\n9. Find the next 'w': 'w1' at position 13.\n   - Increment counter = 4.\n10. Find the next 'w': 'w1' at position 12.\n    - Increment counter = 5.\n11. Find the next 'w': 'w1' at position 11.\n    - Increment counter = 6.\n12. Counter now equals 'w' (3), so print the digit at position 11: '1'.\n13. Reset counter = 0.\n14. Continue iterating until the end of the string.\n\nThe final output is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
