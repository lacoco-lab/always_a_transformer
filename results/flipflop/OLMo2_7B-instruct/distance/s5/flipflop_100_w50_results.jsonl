Initialize a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string from the rightmost character using a loop until the character is not 'w'.\n3. Inside the loop, check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment the `index` variable.\n4. Once the character is not 'w', the `index` variable will hold the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n5. Convert the `index` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    index = -1  # Initialize index to -1 (which represents a non-existent position)\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):  # Iterate from the end to the beginning\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':  # Check if the character is 'w'\n            index = i  # Update the index if 'w' is found\n    if index == -1:  # If no 'w' was found, return 0\n        return '0'\n    else:\n        return str(index + 1)  # Convert index to its corresponding digit (1)\n\ninput_string = \"w1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0r1i1i0i0r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1i1i0w0i0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0r0i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r\"\noutput = find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string)\n<answer>1</answer>"}
