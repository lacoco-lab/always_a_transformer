For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. Once 'w' is encountered, check if `index` is equal to `w` + 1 (since we need the digit after the **right most** 'w').\n5. If `index` equals `w + 1`, return the character at that position in the string.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\nInput: w1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1i0r1i0r1i0i0i1r1r1i0r1r1r1w1r\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. `index = 0` (start at the second character)\n2. Iterate through the string:\n   - Character at index 1 is '1', so `index = 1`\n   - Character at index 2 is 'r', so `index = 2`\n   - Character at index 3 is 'i', so `index = 3`\n   - Character at index 4 is '0', so `index = 4`\n   - Character at index 5 is 'r', so `index = 5`\n   - Character at index 6 is '1', so `index = 6`\n   - Character at index 7 is 'i', so `index = 7`\n   - Character at index 8 is '0', so `index = 8`\n   - Character at index 9 is 'r', so `index = 9`\n   - Character at index 10 is 'i', so `index = 10`\n   - Character at index 11 is '0', so `index = 11`\n   - Character at index 12 is 'r', so `index = 12`\n   - Character at index 13 is '1', so `index = 13`\n   - Character at index 14 is 'w', so `index = 14`\n   - Character at index 15 is 'r', so `index = 15`\n\n3. Check if `index` equals `w + 1`:\n   - `w` is '1', so `w + 1 = 2`\n   - `index` is 15, which is not equal to 2.\n\nSince the loop continues until the end of the string and `index` never equals `w + 1`, there is no digit after the rightmost 'w'.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. Count the occurrences of the character 'w'.\n4. When the count of 'w' reaches or exceeds 'w', print the character at the current index.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string, w):\n    index = len(input_string) - 1\n    count_w = 0\n    \n    # Iterate from the end of the string\n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            count_w += 1\n        if count_w == w:\n            return chr(index)  # Convert the index to the corresponding character\n\n    return None  # If 'w' does not occur 'w' times from the right\n\ninput_string = \"w0i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i1i1i1ir0r0r0r0i0i1i0r0i0w0r\"\nw = 5\n\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string, w)\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(output_digit) + \"</answer>"}
