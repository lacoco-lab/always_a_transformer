Initialize a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the position `index` until we find the character 'w'.\n3. For each iteration, increment `index` by 1.\n4. Check if the character at the current position is 'w'. If it is, return the digit at the position `index` (which is the rightmost 'w').\n5. If the loop completes without finding 'w', return 0 as there is no 'w' to the right.\n\nHere is the Python code to implement this algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(input_string) and input_string[index] != 'w':\n        index += 1\n    if index < len(input_string) and input_string[index] == 'w':\n        return str(input_string[index])\n    else:\n        return 0\n\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1r1i1i1i0i0r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1i1i1i1i1i1r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1w0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r\"\noutput = find_rightmost_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
