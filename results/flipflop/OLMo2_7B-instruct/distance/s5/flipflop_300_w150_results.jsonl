Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of 'w' characters encountered.\n2. Iterate through the input string character by character.\n3. Increment the counter each time a 'w' is encountered.\n4. When the counter reaches 'w' (the target number of 'w' characters), find the position of this 'w' in the string and return the digit at that position.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string, w):\n    counter = 0\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char == 'w':\n            counter += 1\n        if counter == w:\n            return int(input_string[counter - 1])  # Return the digit at the position 'w'\n    return None  # If no 'w' found or reached beyond the string length\n\n# Given input\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1r0i0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i1r0r0i1i0i1r0r0r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0w0i1i1r0r0r0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0r0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0w0i1i1r0r0r0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0r0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0w0i1i1r0r0r0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0r0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0\"\n\n# Target 'w' value\nw = 5\n\n# Find and print the digit after the 5th 'w'\nresult = find_digit_after_w(input_string, w)\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(result) + \"</answer>"}
