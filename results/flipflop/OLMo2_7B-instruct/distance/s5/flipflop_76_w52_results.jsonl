Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If `index` is equal to `w` (the number of 'w' characters), return the character at the `index` position in the string.\n5. If the current character is not 'w', move to the next character without incrementing `index`.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w0i1i0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i1r0r0i1i1i0r0i0w0i1r0r\n```\n\nWe start at the end of the string and move left:\n\n- The rightmost character is '0'. `index = 0` (no increment since '0' is not 'w').\n- The next character is 'r'. `index = 1`.\n- The next character is '0'. `index = 2`.\n- The next character is 'r'. `index = 3`.\n- The next character is '0'. `index = 4`.\n- The next character is 'r'. `index = 5`.\n- The next character is '0'. `index = 6`.\n- The next character is 'r'. `index = 7`.\n- The next character is '0'. `index = 8`.\n- The next character is 'r'. `index = 9`.\n- The next character is 'i'. `index = 10` (increment since 'i' is not 'w').\n\nSince `index = 10` and we are looking for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w', which is the 10th character from the right, we find that the character at `index = 10` is 'i'.\n\nTherefore, the output digit is:\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
