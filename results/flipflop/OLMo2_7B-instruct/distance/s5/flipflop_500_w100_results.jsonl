Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning.\n3. Increment the counter each time we encounter a 'w'.\n4. When we find the rightmost 'w', the counter will give us the position of the digit we need.\n5. Return the digit at the position indicated by the counter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i1i1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i1i0i1i0r0r0i1i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i0r0i1r0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0i1i0r0r0i0i0i1r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i0r0i1r0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0i1i0r0r0i0i0i1r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0i1i0r0r0i0i0i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r</answer>"}
