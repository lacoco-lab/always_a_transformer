Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. Continue iterating until `index` is greater than or equal to the length of the string minus 1 (to avoid going out of bounds).\n5. The digit at the position `index` (0-indexed) is the answer.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0w1r\"\noutput_digit = input_string.rfind('w') + 1  # +1 to convert 0-indexed to 1-indexed\n\n<answer><output_digit></output_digit></answer>"}
