Initialize a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the second character (index 1) until the end of the string.\n3. For each iteration, check if the character at the current position is 'w'.\n4. If the character is 'w', increment the `index` by 1.\n5. Once 'w' is not found at the current position, return the character at the `index` as the output.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0i1r1w1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1r\n```\n\nFollowing the steps:\n\n- Start at index 1 (`w1`), 'w' is found, so `index` = 1.\n- Move to index 2 (`r1`), 'w' is not found, so continue to next character.\n- Continue this process until the end of the string.\n\nThe loop will end when 'w' is not found at index 13 (`r1i0r1i0r1`), which means the rightmost 'w' is at index 12 (`r1i0r1`). The character at index 12 is 'i1'.\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

If the current character is not 'w', check if `index` is equal to `w` (the number of 'w' characters encountered so far).\n6. If `index` equals `w`, return the character at the current position in the string as the output.\n7. If `index` is greater than `w`, return the character at the position `w` in the string as the output.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\nInput: w1i0r1i1r1i0r1i1i1i1i1r1w1i0r1i1i1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize `index` to 0.\n2. Start iterating from the second character ('i') of the string.\n3. The characters encountered are: 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1'.\n4. Count the number of 'w' characters encountered: 1 ('w1'), 1 ('w1'), 1 ('w1'), 1 ('w1').\n5. The `index` after encountering the 4th 'w' is 4.\n6. The character at index 4 in the string is 'i'.\n\nTherefore, the output digit is: <i></answer>"}

Therefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is the character at index `11`, which is outside the string's range.\n\nHowever, since we are asked for the digit (0 or 1) after the **rightmost** 'w' character, and the index `10` corresponds to the character 'r', we should consider the digit value of the character at index `11` in the extended string (if it existed). But since the string ends at index `10`, we need to interpret the problem as asking for the immediate next position's digit value in a theoretical extension of the string.\n\nGiven the constraints of the problem and the string's actual length, the immediate next position in a theoretical extension would be `11`, which is out of bounds for the given string. However, if we consider the problem's intent to be about the digit immediately following the last 'w' in a conceptual sense, and since the string ends at 'r' (index 10), the task might imply looking at the first character of the next string iteration or considering the digit value of the character at the end of the string.\n\nGiven the confusion in interpretation due to the problem's phrasing, let's clarify: the **rightmost** 'w' in the given string is at index `10`, and the next position in a string extension would be `11`, which is not part of the given string. However, if we strictly follow the task's instruction without considering string extension, the immediate next position is not defined within the string's bounds.\n\nGiven the ambiguity and the need for a clear answer based on the provided instruction, the task as stated does not have a clear digit to output within the string's defined bounds. If we assume the task intends to ask for the digit value of the character at the end of the string (index 10), which is 'r', and convert it to a digit (0 in this case), the answer would be:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If the character is not 'w', check if `index` is equal to `w`. If it is, return the character at the current position (which is the digit after the **right most** 'w').\n5. If the loop completes without finding a 'w' at the current `index`, return `None` as there is no such digit.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string, w):\n    index = 1  # Start from the second character\n    for i in range(len(input_string)):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            index += 1\n        if input_string[i] != 'w' and index == w:\n            return input_string[i]\n        if index > len(input_string):  # No more 'w' characters\n            return None\n    return None\n\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1i0i1i0i0i0i0r1r1i0w1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r\"\nw = 5  # Example value for 'w', adjust as needed\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string, w)\n<answer>\n0</answer>"}
