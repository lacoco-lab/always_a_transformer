Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n4. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `count`.\n5. If the character is not 'w', check if `count` equals `w`. If it does, return the character at the `index` position.\n6. Increment `index` after each character to move to the next position.\n7. If no 'w' character is found after `w` occurrences, return the last character in the string.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w0i1i1r0i1r0r0i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i1r0i1i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0i1r0r\n```\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. `index = 0` (start from the rightmost character)\n2. `count = 0` (initialize the count of 'w' characters)\n\nIterating through the string from right to left:\n\n- The last character is 'r', so `index = 11`.\n- 'r' is not 'w', so `count = 0` and `index = 10`.\n- The character is '0', so `index = 9`.\n- '0' is not 'w', so `count = 0` and `index = 8`.\n- 'i' is not 'w', so `count = 0` and `index = 7`.\n- '1' is not 'w', so `count = 0` and `index = 6`.\n- 'i1' is not 'w', so `count = 0` and `index = 5`.\n- 'r0' is not 'w', so `count = 0` and `index = 4`.\n- 'i1' is not 'w', so `count = 0` and `index = 3`.\n- 'r0' is not 'w', so `count = 0` and `index = 2`.\n- 'i1' is not 'w', so `count = 0` and `index = 1`.\n- 'i0' is not 'w', so `count = 0` and `index = 0`.\n\nAt this point, `count = 5` (since we found 5 'w' characters).\n\nSince `count` equals `w` (which is 5), we return the character at `index` position, which is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
