The string contains a repeating pattern of '0's and '1's followed by 'r' and another repeating sequence of '0's, '1's, and 'r's.\n\n2. **Determine the length of one pattern**: The repeating pattern is \"01r01r\". This pattern repeats multiple times.\n\n3. **Find the position of the 'w' character**: We need to find the position of the 'w' character from the rightmost side.\n\n4. **Calculate the position of the required digit**: Once we have the position of 'w', we calculate the position of the digit immediately after it.\n\nLet's break down the steps with the given string:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the repeating pattern and its length**\n\nThe repeating pattern is \"01r01r\". The length of this pattern is 6 characters.\n\n**Step 2: Find the position of the 'w' character**\n\nThe string provided is very long, and finding the exact position of 'w' manually is impractical. However, we can use the repeating pattern to determine the position of 'w'. \n\n**Step 3: Calculate the position of the required digit**\n\nOnce we have the position of 'w', we add 1 to get the position of the digit immediately after 'w'. Since the pattern length is 6, the position after 'w' will be `position_of_w + 1`.\n\n**Step 4: Implement the solution**\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    # Find the position of the last 'w' from the right\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            # The position of 'w' is i-1 (since indexing starts from 0)\n            position_of_w = i - 1\n            # The digit after 'w' is at position (position_of_w + 1)\n            digit_after_w = input_string[position_of_w + 1]\n            return digit_after_w\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w1i0i1i0i1i1r1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1w1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1i1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0i1r1i0i1i0i0r1r1i1r1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0i1r1i0i1i0i0r1r1i1r1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1\"\n\n# Find the digit after the last 'w'\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string)\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(output_digit) + \"</answer>"}

The sequences repeat multiple times.\n2. **Determine the position of the 'w' character**: We need to find the position of the 'w' character from the rightmost side of the string.\n3. **Extract the digit after the 'w'**: Once the position is identified, we extract the digit at that position from the string.\n\nLet's break down the steps programmatically:\n\n1. **Identify the repeating pattern**: Each sequence is \"r\" followed by 1 to 4 'i' characters. The sequence repeats multiple times.\n2. **Calculate the total length of one sequence**: One sequence is 1 character ('r') + 1 to 4 ('i') characters = 2 to 5 characters.\n3. **Determine the total number of sequences**: The string length is 81 characters. We divide 81 by the length of one sequence to find out how many times the pattern repeats.\n4. **Find the position of the 'w'**: Since 'w' is the last character in the sequence, its position is the length of one sequence minus 1.\n5. **Extract the digit**: The digit after the 'w' is the character at the position found in step 4.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    # Length of one sequence (r followed by 1 to 4 i characters)\n    sequence_length = 2 + max(1, 4)  # 2 for 'r' + 1 to 4 'i' characters\n    \n    # Total number of sequences\n    num_sequences = len(input_string) // sequence_length\n    \n    # Position of the 'w' character (last character of each sequence)\n    position_of_w = sequence_length - 1\n    \n    # Extract the digit after the 'w'\n    digit_after_w = input_string[position_of_w]\n    \n    return digit_after_w\n\ninput_string = \"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</answer>"}
