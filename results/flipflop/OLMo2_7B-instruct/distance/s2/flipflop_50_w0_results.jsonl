Convert this position to a 1-based index (since Python uses 0-based indexing).\n7. Retrieve the character at this position.\n8. If the character is '0', return '0'. Otherwise, if it is '1', return '1'.\n9. If no 'w' is found, return '0' as there is no digit after the rightmost 'w'.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    index = 1  # Start from the second character\n    while True:\n        index += 1\n        if input_string[index-1] == 'w':\n            next_char_index = len(input_string) + index - 1  # Convert to 1-based index\n            next_char = input_string[next_char_index]\n            if next_char == '0':\n                return '0'\n            else:\n                return '1'\n        else:\n            break  # Exit loop if 'w' is not found\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w1i0i1i1r1i1i0r1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1i1i0i1r1r1r1r\"\n\n# Find and print the digit after the rightmost 'w'\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string)\n<answer>1</answer>"}
