Print the digit that matches this count.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Find the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    rightmost_w_pos = input_string.rfind('w')\n    \n    # Count the number of characters after the rightmost 'w'\n    count = len(input_string) - rightmost_w_pos\n    \n    # Print the digit corresponding to the count\n    return str(count)\n\ninput_string = \"w0r0r0i1i0i0w1r1r1r\"\noutput = find_rightmost_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
