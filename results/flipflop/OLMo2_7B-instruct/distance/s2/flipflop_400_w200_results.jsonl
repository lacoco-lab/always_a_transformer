Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment the counter.\n4. When the rightmost 'w' is found, stop the iteration.\n5. Return the value of the counter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1i1r1i0i0r1r1i1i1i0r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i1r1i1i0r1i1i0i1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0r1r1i0i0i0i0w0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i1r0r0i0i1r0i1i0i1i0r0r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i0i1i1i0r0r0i1i0i0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0i1r0i1r0i1i0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0i1r0i1r0i1i0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0r0r0r\"\n\ncounter = 0\nindex = len(input_string) - 1\n\nwhile index >= 0 and input_string[index] != 'w':\n    index -= 1\n\nif input_string[index] == 'w':\n    counter += 1\n    break\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
