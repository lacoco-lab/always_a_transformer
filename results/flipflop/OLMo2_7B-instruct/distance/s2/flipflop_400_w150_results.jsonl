Continue iterating until the end of the string.\n\nHere's the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1r1r1i1i0i0i1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i0i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0i1r1i1i0r1i0w1i0i0i0i1r1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1i1i0r1r1i0i0i1i1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1</answer>"}
