Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. Count the number of 'i' characters encountered from the current position `index` until the end of the string.\n4. When the count of 'i' characters equals `w`, return the character at the current position `index`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string, w):\n    index = len(input_string) - 1\n    count_i = 0\n    while count_i < w:\n        if input_string[index] == 'i':\n            count_i += 1\n        index -= 1\n    return input_string[index]\n\ninput_string = \"w0i0i1r0r0i1i1i1i0i1i1r0i1i1i1i0r0r0r0i1r0i0w0r\"\nw = 4  # Example value for w, you can change this as needed\n\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string, w)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
