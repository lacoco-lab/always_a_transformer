Increment `index` to `5`.\n- The next character is '1'. `index = 6`.\n- The next character is 'r'. `index = 7`.\n- The next character is '0'. `index = 8`.\n- The next character is 'i'. `index = 9`.\n- The next character is '0'. `index = 10`.\n- The next character is 'r'. `index = 11`.\n- The next character is '0'. `index = 12`.\n- The next character is 'w'. Increment `index` to `13`.\n- The next character is '1'. `index = 14`.\n- The next character is 'r'. `index = 15`.\n- The next character is '1'. `index = 16`.\n\nSince `index = 16` and the 16th character is '1', the output digit is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
