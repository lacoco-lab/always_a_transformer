Iterate through the string from the rightmost character to the leftmost character (using negative indexing for Python).\n3. Increment `count` each time a 'w' is encountered.\n4. When a 'w' is not found (i.e., the end of the string is reached), the `count` will give the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n5. Retrieve the digit at the `count`th position from the string and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i0i0i1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1i0i1i1i0i0i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i0i0r1r1r1r1i0i0i0r1r1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i0i0r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1r1i1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i0r1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r</answer>"}

Iterate through the string from the rightmost character to the leftmost character (using negative indexing for Python).\n3. If the current character is 'w', increment `count`.\n4. The position of the rightmost 'w' is `len(input_string) - count`.\n5. Return the digit at the position found in step 4.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    # Initialize count of 'w' characters\n    count_w = 0\n    # Iterate from the end of the string to the beginning\n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            count_w += 1\n    # Calculate the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    position = len(input_string) - count_w\n    # Return the digit at the calculated position\n    return str(input_string[position])\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0r0r0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0i0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i1i0i1r0r0i1i0i0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0r0r0r0i1i1i1i1r0i0i1i1i0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i1r0i1i0i0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1r0r0i0r0i0i1r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i1r0i1i0i0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1r0r0i0r0i0i1r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i1r0i1i0i0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1r0r0i0r0i0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i1i1r0i0i1i1i0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0</answer>"}
