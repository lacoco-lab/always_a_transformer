When 'w' is encountered, determine the position of the next 'w' by adding `count` to `index`.\n6. If the next 'w' is found within the string, return the character at that position.\n7. If no 'w' is found after incrementing `index` by `count`, return 0 (indicating no digit follows the last 'w').\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    index = len(input_string) - 1\n    count = 0\n    next_w_index = 0\n    \n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            count += 1\n        if count > 0:\n            next_w_index = index + count\n            if next_w_index < len(input_string):\n                return str(input_string[next_w_index])\n            else:\n                return 0  # No digit follows if we reach the end of the string without finding the next 'w'\n        index -= 1\n    \n    return 0  # Return 0 if no 'w' is found after traversing the string\n\ninput_string = \"w0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i0i0r0w1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r\"\noutput = find_digit_after_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
