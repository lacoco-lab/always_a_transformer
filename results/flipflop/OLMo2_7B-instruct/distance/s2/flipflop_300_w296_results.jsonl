When the character is not 'w', print the digit corresponding to the current counter value (0 or 1) and reset the counter to 0.\n5. Continue this process until the entire string has been processed.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0i1r0i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i1i1i1i0r0r0r0i1r0i0i0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0w0r\"\n\n# Initialize counter\ncounter = 0\n\n# Iterate through the string from the rightmost character\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        counter += 1\n    else:\n        # Print the digit corresponding to the counter\n        answer = '1' if counter % 2 == 1 else '0'\n        print(answer)\n        counter = 0\n\n# The final answer after processing the entire string\n</answer>"}
