Start at the end of the string: `r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0r0r0i1i1i0r0i1w0r`\n2. Find the first 'w': `w0i0i0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0r0r0i1i1i0r0i1`\n   - `index` is now 11\n3. Check if `index` is equal to `w` (which is 3): `index = 11` and `w = 3`\n   - No, they are not equal, so continue to the next character.\n4. Move to the next character: `0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0r0r0i1i1i0r0i1`\n   - `index` is now 10\n5. Find the character at `index 10`: `0`\n6. Since `index` is still 10 and not equal to `w` (3), continue to the next character.\n7. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until `index` equals `w`.\n\nAfter following the steps, the character at index 3 is `0`.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

For each iteration, check if the current character is 'w'.\n4. If the current character is 'w', increment the `index` by 1.\n5. Once the character is not 'w', check the value of `index`. This will give the position of the rightmost 'w' character.\n6. Convert this position to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    index = 1  # Start from the second character\n    while index < len(input_string) and input_string[index] != 'w':\n        index += 1\n    rightmost_w_index = index  # This is the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    return str(rightmost_w_index)  # Convert to digit and return\n\ninput_string = \"w0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0w0r\"\noutput = find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
