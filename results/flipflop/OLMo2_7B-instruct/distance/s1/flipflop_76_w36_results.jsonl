Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If `index` is equal to `w` (the number of 'w' characters), return the character at the `index` position in the string.\n5. Continue iterating until the end of the string.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w0i0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0r0i0i0w0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r\n```\n\nUsing the algorithm:\n\n1. Start at the end of the string: `r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0r0i0i0w0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r`\n2. Find the first 'w': `w0i0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0r0i0i0w0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r`\n   - `index` is now 16.\n3. Check if `index` equals `w` (which is 6): `16 != 6`\n4. Move to the next character: `i0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0r0i0i0w0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r`\n   - `index` is now 15.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until `index` equals `w` (6):\n   - `15 != 6`\n   - Move to the next character: `i0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0r0i0i0w0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r`\n   - `index` is now 14.\n   - `14 != 6`\n   - Move to the next character: `r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0r0i0i0w0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r`\n   - `index` is now 13.\n   - `13 != 6`\n   - Move to the next character: `i0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0r0i0i0w0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r`\n   - `index` is now 12.\n   - `12 != 6`\n   - Move to the next character: `r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0r0i0i0w0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r`\n   - `index` is now 11.\n   - `11 != 6`\n   - Move to the next character: `i0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0r0i0i0w0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1r0r`\n   - `index` is now 10.\n   - `10 == 6`\n\nSince `index` is now equal to `w`, the character at this position is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
