Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Determine the digit immediately following this 'w' character.\n\nLet's break down the input string and find the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput: w0i1i1i0i0i0i1r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1r0i0i1i1r0i0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0i0r0i1r0i1r0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at position 32.\n\nNow, let's find the digit immediately following this 'w'. We'll count the characters from the rightmost 'w' until we reach a non-'w' character:\n\n- 'w' at position 32\n- '0' at position 33\n- 'i' at position 34\n- '1' at position 35\n- 'i' at position 36\n- '1' at position 37\n- 'r' at position 38\n\nThe first non-'w' character after position 32 is 'r' at position 38.\n\nSince we are asked for the digit **after** the rightmost 'w', we need to consider the character at position 38.\n\nThe character at position 38 is 'r'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 'r', which in terms of digits is represented as 18 (since 'r' is the 18th digit in the English alphabet).\n\n<answer>18</answer>"}

Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment the counter.\n4. When the character is not 'w', print the digit corresponding to the current counter value and reset the counter to 0.\n5. Continue this process until the entire string has been processed.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i0i1r0i1r0i1i0r0i0r0i0i1i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0r0i0r0i0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0i0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r\"\n\n# Initialize counter\ncounter = 0\n\n# Iterate through the string from the right\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        counter += 1\n    else:\n        # Print the digit corresponding to the counter and reset the counter\n        print(str(counter))\n        counter = 0\n\n</answer>"}
