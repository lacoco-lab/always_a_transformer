Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of 'w' characters encountered.\n2. Iterate through the string from the rightmost character to the leftmost character (using negative indexing for Python).\n3. Increment `count` each time a 'w' is encountered.\n4. When the character is 'w', check if `count` is equal to the current index (which represents the rightmost occurrence of 'w').\n5. If they are equal, return the character at that index.\n6.

Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1 to keep track of the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If the character is 'w', update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n5. After iterating through the entire string, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n6. Convert `last_w_index` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    last_w_index = -1\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            last_w_index = i\n    return str(last_w_index + 1)  # Convert index to digit (0 or 1)\n\ninput_string = \"w0r0i1r0i1r0i0i0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0r0w1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i0i1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r</answer>"}

Iterate through the string from the rightmost character to the leftmost character (using negative indexing for Python).\n3. If the current character is 'w', increment `count`.\n4. The position of the rightmost 'w' is `len(input_string) - count`.\n5. Return the digit at the position `position`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    # Initialize count of 'w' characters\n    count_w = 0\n    # Iterate from the end of the string to the beginning\n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            count_w += 1\n    # Calculate the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    position = len(input_string) - count_w\n    # Return the digit at the calculated position\n    return str(input_string[position])\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1i1r0i1i0r0i1i1r0i1r0i1r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0w0i0i0r0i1r0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i1r0i1i0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i0i0r0i1i1i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1i0r0i0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i</answer>"}
