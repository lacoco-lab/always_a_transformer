Convert this position to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i0r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1i0i1i1i0i0i1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1i1r1i0i1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1i1r1i0i0i0r1i1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1r1w0r\"\n\n# Find the position of the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_position = input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Convert the position to the corresponding digit (0 or 1)\noutput_digit = str(rightmost_w_position + 1)  # +1 to convert 0 to '0' and 1 to '1'\n\n# Print the output digit\nprint(\"<answer>\" + output_digit + \"</answer>"}
