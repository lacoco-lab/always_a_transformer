Determine the digit immediately after this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the input string and find the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput: w0i1i1r0i0i0r0i1i0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0i1r0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i1i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i1i0i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' in this string is at position 63.\n\nNow, we need to find the digit immediately after this 'w'. We will do this by slicing the string from the character after the 63rd 'w' to the end and then converting the resulting string to a list of digits. The first digit in this list will be our answer.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1r0i0i0r0i1i0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0i1r0i0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i1i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i1i0i1r\"\n\n# Find the position of the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_position = 63\n\n# Slice the string from the character after the rightmost 'w' to the end\ndigit_after_w = input_string[rightmost_w_position + 1 : len(input_string)]\n\n# Convert the sliced string to a list of digits\ndigits_after_w = [int(char) for char in digit_after_w]\n\n# The first digit in the list is the answer\noutput_digit = digits_after_w[0]\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
