Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If `index` is equal to `w` (the number of 'w' characters), return the character at the `index` position in the string.\n5. If the current character is not 'w', move to the next character without incrementing `index`.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w0i0i1i1r0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i0r0i0i1i0r0i0w1r1i1i0i0r1r\n```\n\nWe start from the rightmost character and move left:\n\n- The rightmost character is 'r', so `index = 0`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 1`.\n- The next character is 'i', so `index = 2`.\n- The next character is '1', so `index = 3`.\n- The next character is 'r', so `index = 4`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 5`.\n- The next character is 'r', so `index = 6`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 7`.\n- The next character is 'r', so `index = 8`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 9`.\n- The next character is 'i', so `index = 10`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 11`.\n- The next character is 'i', so `index = 12`.\n- The next character is '1', so `index = 13`.\n- The next character is 'r', so `index = 14`.\n- The next character is '1', so `index = 15`.\n\nSince `index = 15` and the 15th character from the right in the given string is '1', the output is:\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
