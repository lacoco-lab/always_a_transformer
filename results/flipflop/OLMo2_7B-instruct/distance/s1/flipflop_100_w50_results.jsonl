Initialize a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string from the rightmost character using a loop until the character is not 'w'.\n3. Inside the loop, check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment the `index` variable.\n4. Once the character is not 'w', the `index` variable will hold the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n5. Convert the `index` to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1r1i0i1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1r1i0r1i0w1i1i0r1r1i1i1r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r\"\n\n# Find the index of the rightmost 'w'\nindex = -1\nfor i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n    if input_string[i] == 'w':\n        index = i\n        break\n\n# Convert the index to the corresponding digit\noutput_digit = str(index + 1) if index + 1 < 2 else '0'  # +1 to convert 0 to 1\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
