Initialize a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string character by character, incrementing `index` by 1 for each character.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, note the position.\n4. Continue iterating until the end of the string.\n5. The position of the rightmost 'w' is the value stored in `index`.\n6. Convert this position to the corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    index = 0\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char == 'w':\n            index += 1\n        if index == len(input_string):  # End of string\n            break\n    # Convert the index to the corresponding digit\n    return str(index).index('1') + 1 if index == len(input_string) else 0\n\ninput_string = \"w1i1i0r1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1i1i1i0i0w1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i0i0r1i0r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1i0i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1i1i1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1r1r1i1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i1i0r1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1\"\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
