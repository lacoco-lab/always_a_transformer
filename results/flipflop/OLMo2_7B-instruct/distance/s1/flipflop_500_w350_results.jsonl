Initialize a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string from the beginning to the end.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment the `index`.\n4. Once the loop completes, `index` will hold the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n5. Return the digit at the `index` position in the string.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i1r1r1i0i1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i1i0r1i1i1i1r1i0i1i1i1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i0i0r1i1i1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1i0r1i1i0r1i1r1i1i1i0r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i0i1i1r1r1i1i0i0r1i0i1i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i0i0i1r1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1i1i1i0i0i0w0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1i1r0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i0i0r0i0i0r0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0i1i0r0i0i1i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0i0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r\"\n\nindex = 0\nfor char in input_string:\n    if char == 'w':\n        index += 1\n    if index > len(input_string):  # Exit loop if 'w' is not found\n        break\n\nanswer = input_string[index]\n</answer>"}

Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning.\n3. Increment the counter each time we encounter a 'w'.\n4. When the counter equals the position of the rightmost 'w', stop the iteration.\n5. Return the digit at the current index of the counter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i1r1r1i0i0r1i0r1i0i0i0i1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i0r1i1i1i1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1r1i0i1i0i1r1i1r1r1i0i1i0i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i0i0i1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1i0r1i0r1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i1i0i0i0r1i1i1i1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1r1i1i1i0r1i0i1r1i1i0i1r1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1i1i0r1r1i0i1i1r1r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1w0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1i1i0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i1r0i0i0r0i0r0i1i0i1r0r0r0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1i1i1r0r0r\"\n\n# Find the position of the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = -1\nfor i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n    if input_string[i] == 'w':\n        rightmost_w_index = i\n        break\n\n# Get the digit at the rightmost 'w' position\noutput_digit = int(input_string[rightmost_w_index])\n\n<answer>\n0</answer>"}
