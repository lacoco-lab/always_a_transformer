Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' in the input string.\n2. Count the number of characters from the rightmost 'w' to the end of the string.\n3. Print the digit at the counted position.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string \"w1i1i1r1i1r1w0r0r0r\":\n\n1. The rightmost 'w' is at position 16 (0-indexed).\n2. The total number of characters from the rightmost 'w' to the end of the string is 21 (from position 16 to position 36).\n\nTherefore, the digit at position 21 is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
