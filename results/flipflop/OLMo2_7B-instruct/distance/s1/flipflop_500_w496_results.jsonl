Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment the counter.\n4. When the character is not 'w', print the digit (0 or 1) corresponding to the current value of the counter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i1i1i0i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1i1r1r1i1i0r1i1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1i1i0i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i0i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i0i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i0i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i0r1i1i1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1i0r1i1i1r1i1r1i1i0r1i1i1i1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i0i1r1i0r1r1r1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i0r1r1i1i0r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i0w1r\"\n\ncounter = 0\nresult = \"\"\n\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        counter += 1\n    else:\n        result = str(counter % 2) + result\n        counter = 0\n\nprint(\"<answer>\" + result + \"</answer>"}
