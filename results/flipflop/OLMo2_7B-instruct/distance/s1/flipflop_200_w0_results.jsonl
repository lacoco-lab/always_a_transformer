When the character is not 'w', check if the counter is equal to 'w'. If it is, print the digit corresponding to the counter (which will be either 0 or 1) and reset the counter to 0.\n5. Continue this process until the end of the string.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0i1i0r1i1i0r1i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i0i0r1r1i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i1i1i1r1i0i1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0i1r1r1i0i0i0i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r\"\n\n# Initialize counter\ncounter = 0\n\n# Iterate through the string\nfor char in input_string:\n    if char == 'w':\n        counter += 1\n    else:\n        if counter == 'w':\n            # Print the digit corresponding to the counter\n            print('<answer>1</answer>"}
