Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, if it is 'w', increment the counter.\n4. When the character is not 'w', print the digit in the counter and reset the counter to 0.\n5. Continue this process until the entire string has been iterated.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1i1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1i0r1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1w1i0i1i0r1i1i0i1r1i0i1r1i1r1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i0r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i0r1i1i0r1i0r1i1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1</answer>"}
