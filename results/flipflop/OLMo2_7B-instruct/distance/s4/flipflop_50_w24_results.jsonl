Initialize a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the second character (index 1) until the end.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If the character is not 'w', check if `index` is equal to `w`. If it is, return the character at the current position (which is the digit we are looking for).\n5. Increment `index` to move to the next position.\n6. Continue the loop until the end of the string.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\nInput: w1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0w1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i0i0r\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string, w):\n    index = 1\n    result = \"\"\n    for char in input_string[1:]:\n        if char == 'w':\n            index += 1\n        elif index == w:\n            result = char\n            index += 1\n        else:\n            index += 1\n    return result\n\ninput_string = \"w1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0w1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i0i0r\"\nw = 5  # Example value for 'w', can be adjusted as needed\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string, w)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
