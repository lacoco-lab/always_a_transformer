Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If `index` is equal to `w` (the number of 'w' characters), return the character at the `index` position in the string.\n5. Move to the next character and repeat the process until the end of the string is reached.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string, w):\n    index = 0\n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            index += 1\n        if index == w:\n            return char\n        index += 1\n    return None\n\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1r0i1i0r0r0i0i0i1r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0w0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0i1r\"\nw = 5  # Number of 'w' characters\n\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string, w)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
