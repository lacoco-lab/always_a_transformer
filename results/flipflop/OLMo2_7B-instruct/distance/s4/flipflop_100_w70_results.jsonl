Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. Increment the counter for each 'w' character found.\n4. Once the counter equals 'w', print the digit at that position (0 or 1) and reset the counter.\n5. Continue this process until the entire string is processed.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0i0i0r0r0i1r0r0i0i1i0i0r0r0i0i0i1i1i0r0i1r0i1r0i0r0r0i1w1r1r1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1r\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n- Start from the right: 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', '0', 'i', '0', 'r', '0', 'r', '0', 'r', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '0', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'w', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'w', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', '>\n\n- Counter for 'w' is 0 (no 'w' found yet).\n- Continue iterating...\n\n- 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', '0' (no 'w' here)\n- Counter for 'w' is still 0.\n\n- 'i', '0', 'r', '0', 'r', '0', 'r', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '0', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'w', '1', 'r', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', '>\n\n- 'w' found! Counter is now 1.\n- The digit at position 1 (second character from the right) is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
