Convert the counter to its corresponding digit (0 or 1) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Initialize counter\n    counter = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # Check if the character is 'w'\n        if char == 'w':\n            # Increment counter\n            counter += 1\n    \n    # The rightmost 'w' will be at the last index of the loop iteration\n    # Convert the counter to the corresponding digit\n    result_digit = str(counter + 1) if counter else '0'  # Ensure we have a digit, even if counter is 0\n    \n    return <answer>{result_digit}</answer>"}
