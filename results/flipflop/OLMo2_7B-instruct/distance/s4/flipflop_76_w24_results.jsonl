If the current character is not 'w', move to the next character without incrementing `index`.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w0i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i0i1i0r0w0i1r0i1r0i1r0r0i0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i1r0i1r0i0i0r0r\n```\n\nWe start from the rightmost character and move left:\n\n- The rightmost character is 'r', so `index = 0`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 1`.\n- The next character is 'i', so `index = 2`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 3`.\n- The next character is 'r', so `index = 4`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 5`.\n- The next character is 'i', so `index = 6`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 7`.\n- The next character is 'i', so `index = 8`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 9`.\n- The next character is 'r', so `index = 10`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 11`.\n- The next character is 'r', so `index = 12`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 13`.\n- The next character is 'r', so `index = 14`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 15`.\n\nSince `index = 15` and the 15th character from the right in the given string is '0', the output digit is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
