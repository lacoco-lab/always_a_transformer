Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, if it is 'w', increment the counter by 1.\n4. When the character is not 'w', print the digit corresponding to the current counter value and reset the counter to 0.\n5. Continue this process until the entire string has been processed.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i0r0i0i1r0i0r0i1r0r0i1i0r0r0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1i1i0r0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0i0i0r0i0i0r0r0i1r0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i0r0i1i1i0r0i1i1r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i0r0i1i1i0r0i1i1r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i0r0i1i1i0r0i1i1r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i0r0i1i1i0r0i1i1r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i0r0i1i1i0r0i1i1r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0</answer>"}
