We need to find the position of the rightmost 'w' character (where 'w' is either '0' or 'r').\n\n2. **Iterate through the string**: Start from the end of the string and move towards the beginning, checking each character to see if it is 'w'.\n\n3. **Count occurrences of 'r' followed by 'i'**: For each 'r', count the number of 'i' characters that follow it. This count will help us determine the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n\n4. **Determine the position**: Once we find the rightmost 'w', its position (starting from 0) will be our answer.\n\nLet's implement this algorithmically:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Initialize variables\n    position = len(input_string) - 1  # Start from the end\n    count = 0  # Counter for 'ri' sequences\n\n    # Iterate backwards through the string\n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'r':\n            count += 1  # Increase the count for each 'r'\n        elif char == 'i':\n            count = 0  # Reset the count for the next 'r'\n        elif char == 'w':  # Found the 'w'\n            return position  # Return the position of the 'w'\n\n    return None  # If no 'w' found\n\n# Input string\ninput_string = \"w1i1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r1i0r1i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0r1w0i0i0i0i1i0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0r0r0r0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1r0i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i0r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i1i0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0i0i1i1r0r0i0r0r\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_position = find_rightmost_w(input_string)\n<answer>9</answer>"}
