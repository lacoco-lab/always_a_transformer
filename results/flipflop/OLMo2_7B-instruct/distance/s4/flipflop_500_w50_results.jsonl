Iterate through the string from the rightmost character to the leftmost character (using negative indexing for Python).\n3. Increment `count` each time a 'w' is encountered.\n4. When the character is 'w', check if `count` is equal to the current index (which represents the rightmost occurrence of 'w').\n5. If they are equal, return the character at that index.\n6. If `count` exceeds the current index, continue the iteration.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    input_list = list(input_string)\n    \n    # Initialize count and index\n    count = 0\n    index = len(input_list) - 1  # Start from the last character\n    \n    # Iterate from the end to the beginning\n    while count < index:\n        if input_list[index] == 'w':\n            count += 1\n        index -= 1\n    \n    # Return the character at the rightmost 'w'\n    return input_list[index]\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1w0r0r0i0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0r0i0i1r0i0r0r0i0r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0i0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0i0i0r0i1i1r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0i0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0i0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1r0r0i0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0i0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0i0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0i0r0i1i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r</answer>"}

Iterate through the string from the rightmost character to the leftmost character (using negative indexing for Python).\n3. Increment `count` each time a 'w' is encountered.\n4. When the character is 'w', check if `count` is equal to the current index (which represents the rightmost occurrence of 'w').\n5. If they are equal, return the character at that index.\n6. If `count` exceeds the current index, continue the iteration.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    input_list = list(input_string)\n    \n    # Initialize count and index\n    count = 0\n    index = len(input_list) - 1  # Start from the last character\n    \n    # Iterate from the end to the beginning\n    while count < index:\n        if input_list[index] == 'w':\n            count += 1\n        index -= 1\n    \n    # Return the digit at the rightmost 'w'\n    return input_list[index]\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i1i0i0r1i1r1i1r1i0i0i0r1i1w0i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0r0r0i0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1r0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0i1r0i1i1r0i1r0i1i1r0i1r0i1r0i0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i0r0r0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0r0i0i1r0i1r0i1i1r0i1r0i1i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0r0r0i1i1r0i0i0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0r0i0i1r0i1r0i1i1r0i1r0i1r0i0r0i0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0r0i0i1r0i1r0i1i1r0i1r0i1r0i0r0i0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0\"\n\n# Execute the function\noutput_digit = find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, if it is 'w', increment the counter.\n4. When the character is not 'w', print the digit in the counter and reset the counter to 0.\n5. Continue this process until the entire string has been iterated.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i0i0r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i0i1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1w1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0r1i1r1i0i0r1r1r1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i0i0i0r1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1r1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1i0r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1i0i1r1i0i0r1i0i0i0i0i1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1i1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1i0i0i0r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1</answer>"}
