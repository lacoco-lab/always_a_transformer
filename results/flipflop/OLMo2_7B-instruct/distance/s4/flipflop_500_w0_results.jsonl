Iterate through the string from the rightmost character to the leftmost character (using negative indexing for Python).\n3. Increment `count` each time a 'w' is encountered.\n4. When a 'w' is not found (i.e., the iteration reaches the start of the string), the current value of `count` will be the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n5. Return the digit at the position `count`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w_digit(input_string):\n    count = 0\n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            count += 1\n    # The position of the rightmost 'w' is the value of count\n    return int(str(count))\n\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1r1i0i1i0i0i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i0i1i0r1i0i0r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1i1i0r1r1i1i0i0r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i1r1i1i1i0r1i0i0i0i0i0r1i0i1r1i0i0r1r1i0i0r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1i1i0r1r1i1i0i0r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i1r1i1i1i0r1i0i0i0i0i0r1i0i1r1i0i0r1r1i0i0r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1\"\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Iterate through the string from the rightmost character to the leftmost character (using negative indexing for Python).\n3. Increment `count` each time a 'w' is encountered.\n4. When the character is 'w', check if `count` is equal to 1 (the rightmost 'w'). If it is, return the character at the current index.\n5. Continue iterating until the entire string is processed.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1i1i0i1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1r1r1i0i0i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i1r1i1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1i0r1i0i0r1i1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1i0i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0i1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i0r1i1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1r1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i0i0r1i1i0i1r1i0i0i1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1</answer>"}

Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, if it is 'w', increment the counter.\n4. When the character is not 'w', print the digit corresponding to the current counter value.\n5. Reset the counter to 0 for the next iteration.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i0r1r1i1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i0i1i1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i1i1i1i0i0r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1i0i1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i1i1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1i0i1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i1i1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0i1r\"\n\ncounter = 0\noutput_digit = \"\"\n\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        counter += 1\n    else:\n        output_digit = str(counter)\n        counter = 0\n\nprint(\"<answer>\" + output_digit + \"</answer>"}
