We'll count the characters from the rightmost 'w' until we reach a space (' ') or the end of the string.\n\nThe characters following the rightmost 'w' are:\n- '0'\n- 'i'\n- '1'\n- 'i'\n- '1'\n- 'i'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'i'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'i'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'i'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'i'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'i'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'i'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n- 'r'\n- '0'\n\nCounting these characters, we find there are 27 characters from the 'w' to the last 'r' before the first space.\n\nThe 27th character is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
