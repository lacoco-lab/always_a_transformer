The rightmost 'w' in the string \"w0r0i0i0i0i1w1i0i0r\" is at position 13 (0-indexed).\n2. Count the number of characters after the rightmost 'w': There are 10 characters ('i' characters) after the 'w'.\n3. Print the digit corresponding to this count: Since there are 10 characters, the output digit is 1.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
