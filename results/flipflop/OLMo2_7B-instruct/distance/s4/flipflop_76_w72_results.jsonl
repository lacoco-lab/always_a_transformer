Continue iterating until the end of the string.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0i1r0r0i0i0r0r0i0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0w0r\n```\n\nUsing the algorithm:\n\n1. Start at the end of the string: `r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0r0i0i0r0w0r`\n2. Find the first 'w': `w0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0i1r0r0i0i0r0w0r` -> 'w' at index 19\n3. Increment `index`: `19 + 1 = 20`\n4. Find the character at index 20: `r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0r0i0i0r0w0r` -> '0'\n5. Since we are looking for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w', and '0' is the character at index 20, the digit is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Start at the end of the string: `r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1w1r`\n2. Find the first 'w': `w1r`\n3. Increment `index`: `1`\n4. Find the character at index 1: `0`\n5. Continue to the next character: `r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1`\n6. Find the first 'w': `w1r`\n7. Increment `index`: `1`\n8. Find the character at index 1: `0`\n9. Continue to the next character: `i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0r0i1i1r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1`\n10. Find the first 'w': `w1r`\n11. Increment `index`: `1`\n12. Find the character at index 1: `0`\n\nThe digit after the **rightmost** 'w' character is `0`.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
