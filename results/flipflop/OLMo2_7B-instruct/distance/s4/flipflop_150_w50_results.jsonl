Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of 'i' characters encountered.\n2. Iterate through the string from right to left (since we need the digit after the **right most** 'w').\n3. Increment the counter for each 'i' character found.\n4. When the rightmost character is 'w', the counter will tell us the number of 'i' characters that come after it.\n5. Print the digit corresponding to this counter (which will be either 0 or 1).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1i0r1i0r1i0i1i0i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1i1i0r1r1i1w1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1i0i0i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r\"\n\n# Initialize counter for 'i' characters\ni_count = 0\n\n# Iterate through the string from right to left\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'i':\n        i_count += 1\n\n# The rightmost 'w' character's following 'i' count\nright_after_w_i_count = i_count\n\n# Print the digit corresponding to the count\noutput_digit = '0' if right_after_w_i_count == 0 else '1'\n<answer>1</answer>"}
