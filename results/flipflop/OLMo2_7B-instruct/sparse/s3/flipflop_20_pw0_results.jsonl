Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If `index` equals `w` (the number of 'w' characters), return the character at the `index` position in the string.\n5. If the current character is not 'w', move to the next character without incrementing `index`.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string \"w0r0i1i1i0r0i0r0i1r\":\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i1i1i0r0i0r0i1r\"\nw_count = 5  # Number of 'w' characters\n\nindex = len(input_string) - 1  # Start from the last character\n\nwhile index >= 0 and input_string[index] == 'w':\n    index -= 1\n\n# The character at index is the answer\noutput = input_string[index]\noutput\n```\n\nRunning the above code will give us the digit after the **rightmost** 'w' character in the string. The output is:\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
