The string contains a repeating pattern of characters and digits.\n\n2. **Understand the repeating pattern**: The repeating unit in the string is \"i1i1i1i0w1i1i0i1i1i1i0\". This unit repeats several times followed by \"r1i1i0r1w0i1r0i0i1i1i0\".\n\n3. **Determine the length of the repeating unit**: The repeating unit \"i1i1i1i0w1i1i0i1i1i1i0\" has a length of 8 characters.\n\n4. **Find the position of the rightmost 'w'**: To find the rightmost 'w', we need to determine the position of the last occurrence of 'w' in the string. Since the repeating unit is 8 characters long, and the pattern repeats, we need to calculate the position of the last 'w' in the entire string.\n\n5. **Calculate the position**: The string provided is quite long, but we can use the repeating pattern to simplify our calculation. The string can be divided into several repeating blocks plus some additional characters at the end.\n\nLet's break down the calculation:\n\n- **Calculate the number of full repeating blocks**: The string length is 81 characters (not including spaces or 'r'). Each repeating unit is 8 characters long.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of full repeating blocks} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{81}{8} \\right\\rfloor = 10\n  \\]\n  This means there are 10 full repeating units.\n\n- **Determine the position of the last 'w' in the repeating blocks**: In each block, the 'w' is at the 7th position (counting from the right, since positions start from 0).\n\n- **Calculate the position of the last 'w' in the entire string**: After 10 full blocks, we have used \\(10 \\times 8 = 80\\) characters. The remaining characters are \"r1i1i0r1w0i1r0i0i1i1i0\", which are 3 characters long.\n\n  Therefore, the total position of the last 'w' is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 7 + 3 = 70 + 3 = 73\n  \\]\n\n- **Extract the digit after the rightmost 'w'**: The 73rd character in the string is 'i1i1i1i0'.\n\n  The digit after the rightmost 'w' is the 4th character in \"i1i1i1i0\", which is 'i'.\n\n\\[\n<answer>4</answer>"}
