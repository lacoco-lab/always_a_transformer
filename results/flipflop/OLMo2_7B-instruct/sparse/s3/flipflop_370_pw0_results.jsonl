This can be done by calculating the length of the string and then finding the index of the last 'w'.\n\n5. **Extract the digit after the rightmost 'w'**: Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', we can extract the character at that position and convert it to a digit (0 or 1).\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Step 1: Calculate the length of the repeating unit\n    repeating_unit_length = 13\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the total number of repeating units in the input string\n    total_repeats = (len(input_string) + repeating_unit_length - 1) // repeating_unit_length\n    \n    # Step 3: Find the index of the last 'w' in the string\n    last_w_index = len(input_string) - 1 - (total_repeats * repeating_unit_length)\n    \n    # Step 4: Extract the character at the last_w_index and convert it to a digit\n    last_character = input_string[last_w_index]\n    if last_character == 'w':\n        digit = 0\n    else:\n        digit = 1\n    \n    # Step 5: Return the digit\n    return digit\n\n# Input string\ninput_string = \"w1r1i0i1w1i0r1i0i1i1w0i1i1r0w0w0i1w0w0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i1i0r0w0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1w0i1i0i1w0i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0w1w1i0r1i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i1i1r1r1i0i0w1i1i0i0r1i0i1r1i1i1i0w0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1i0i0w1r1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0r0i1w1r1i1i1i0w0i0i1i1i0i1i1r\"\n\n# Find the digit after the rightmost 'w'\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
