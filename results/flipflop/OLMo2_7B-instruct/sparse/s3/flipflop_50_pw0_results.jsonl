If the character is not 'w', print the digit at the current position.\n5. After the loop ends, since we are asked for the digit **after** the rightmost 'w', if `index` is equal to the length of the string, print '0' (since there is no digit after the last character).\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i1i1r0w1i1i0i1r\n```\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. `index = 0`\n2. Loop starts:\n   - At `index = 0`, character is 'w', so `index = 1`\n   - At `index = 1`, character is '0', so print '0'\n   - At `index = 2`, character is 'i', so continue\n   - At `index = 3`, character is 'i', so continue\n   - At `index = 4`, character is '1', so continue\n   - At `index = 5`, character is '0', so print '0'\n   - At `index = 6`, character is 'i', so continue\n   - At `index = 7`, character is '0', so print '0'\n   - At `index = 8`, character is 'i', so continue\n   - At `index = 9`, character is '1', so continue\n   - At `index = 10`, character is '0', so print '0'\n   - At `index = 11`, character is 'r', so continue\n   - At `index = 12`, character is '0', so print '0'\n   - At `index = 13`, character is 'i', so continue\n   - At `index = 14`, character is '1', so continue\n   - At `index = 15`, character is 'r', so continue\n   - At `index = 16`, character is 'w', so `index = 17`\n   - At `index = 17`, character is '1', so continue\n   - At `index = 18`, character is 'i', so continue\n   - At `index = 19`, character is '0', so print '0'\n\nAfter the loop ends, since `index = 19` and there is no digit after the last character, we print '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
