Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If `index` is equal to `w` (the number of 'w' characters), return the character at the `index` position in the string.\n5. Move to the next character in the string after the current one.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r0i1i1w1i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0w1i0r\n```\n\nUsing the algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize `index` to `0`.\n2. Start iterating from the end of the string:\n   - The last character is 'r', so `index` remains `0`.\n   - The character at index `0` is 'w', increment `index` to `1`.\n   - The character at index `1` is '0', so `index` remains `1`.\n   - Continue this process until `index` equals `w` (which is `1` in this case).\n\n3. When `index` equals `w`, the character at that position is '0'.\n\nThus, the output digit is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
