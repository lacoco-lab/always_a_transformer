For each iteration, increment `index`.\n4. When a 'w' character is found, check if `index` is greater than or equal to the desired length `w`.\n5. If `index` is greater than or equal to `w`, print the character at position `index` (which is the digit immediately after the `w` characters).\n6. If `index` is less than `w`, continue the loop.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0w0i1i1i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Set `index = 0`.\n2. Iterate through the string:\n   - After 'i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r': `index = 21`\n   - After 'r': `index = 19`\n   - After '0': `index = 18`\n   - After 'i0': `index = 17`\n   - After 'i0': `index = 16`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 15`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 14`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 13`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 12`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 11`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 10`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 9`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 8`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 7`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 6`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 5`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 4`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 3`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 2`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 1`\n   - After 'i1': `index = 0`\n\n3. Since `index = 0` after the last 'i1', and `w = 5`, we check if `index` is greater than or equal to 5. Here, `index = 0`, which is less than 5.\n\n4. Since `index` is less than `w`, we continue the loop.\n\n5. Repeat the process until the character is not 'w'.\n\n6. When we find 'w' and `index >= 5`, we print the character at `index`.\n\nAfter following the algorithm, the digit after the **right most** 'w' character is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Iterate through the string starting from the end (rightmost character) until the current character is not 'w'.\n4. Increment `count` each time we encounter a 'w'.\n5. Once we reach a character that is not 'w', determine the position of this character relative to the last 'w' by subtracting `count` from the current `index`.\n6. Return the digit at this calculated position.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_last_w(input_string):\n    # Initialize variables\n    index = len(input_string) - 1  # Start from the last character\n    count = 0\n\n    # Iterate from the end of the string\n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\n    # Calculate the position of the character after the last 'w'\n    position = index - count\n\n    # Return the digit at the calculated position\n    return str(input_string[position])\n\n# Input string\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0w0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1w1i0i1r1i0r\"\n\n# Find and print the digit after the last 'w'\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_last_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
