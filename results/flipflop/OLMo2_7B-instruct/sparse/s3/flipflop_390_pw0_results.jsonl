The string contains a repeating pattern of '0's and '1's followed by 'w' and then another sequence of '0's and '1's.\n\n2. **Determine the length of one pattern**: The repeating pattern consists of 13 characters: '1', 'i', '0', '1', 'i', '0', '1', 'i', '0', '1', 'i', '1', 'w'. \n\n3. **Find the position of the rightmost 'w'**: We need to find the index of the rightmost occurrence of 'w' in the string.\n\n4. **Calculate the position of the required digit**: Once we have the index of the rightmost 'w', we calculate the position of the digit immediately after it by adding 14 (the length of the pattern) to that index.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Length of one pattern\n    pattern_length = 13\n    \n    # Find the index of the rightmost 'w'\n    rightmost_w_index = len(input_string) - 1 - input_string.rfind('w')\n    \n    # Calculate the position of the digit after the rightmost 'w'\n    digit_position = rightmost_w_index + pattern_length\n    \n    # Return the digit at the calculated position\n    return str(input_string[digit_position])\n\ninput_string = \"w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0w1i1w1i0w1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1w1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0r1i0i0r1i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i0i1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0w1w1i0i0i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0r1i0r1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0w0r\"\n    \noutput_digit = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
