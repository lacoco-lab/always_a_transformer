The string contains a repeating pattern of 'w', followed by a '1' and then a series of 'i's.\n\n2. **Determine the length of one pattern**: The pattern \"w1i\" repeats and is followed by \"w\". The length of this pattern is 3 characters (w, 1, i).\n\n3. **Find the position of the last 'w'**: We need to find the index of the rightmost 'w'. This can be done by iterating through the string from the end and finding the last occurrence of 'w'.\n\n4. **Calculate the position of the required digit**: Once we have the index of the last 'w', we calculate the position of the digit immediately after it by adding 3 (the length of the pattern) to this index.\n\n5. **Extract and return the digit**: Extract the character at the calculated position and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_last_w(input_string):\n    # Find the index of the last 'w'\n    last_w_index = len(input_string) - 1 - input_string.rfind('w')\n    \n    # Calculate the position of the digit after the last 'w'\n    digit_position = last_w_index + 3\n    \n    # Extract and return the digit\n    return str(input_string[digit_position])\n\ninput_string = \"w1i0i1i1w1i0i0i1r1w0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0w0r0i1w0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i0r0i0i1w1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i0i1i1i1w0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1w0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0w1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1r1i1w0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0r\"\n    result = find_digit_after_last_w(input_string)\n    output = \"<answer>\" + result + \"</answer>"}
