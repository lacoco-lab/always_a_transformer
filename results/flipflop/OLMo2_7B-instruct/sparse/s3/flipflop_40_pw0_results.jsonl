When the character is not 'w', check if `count` equals the current `index`. If it does, return the character at the current `index`.\n6. If the character is 'w' and `count` is still less than `index`, increment `index` and continue the loop.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i1w1r\n```\n\nFollowing the steps:\n\n1. `index = 0` (start from the end)\n2. `count = 0` (no 'w' found yet)\n3. Loop through the string:\n   - At position 0: '0' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 1: 'i' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 2: '1' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 3: 'i' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 4: '1' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 5: 'i' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 6: '0' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 7: 'r' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 8: '0' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 9: 'i' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 10: '1' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 11: 'i' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 12: '0' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 13: '1' (not 'w'), so `count = 0`\n   - At position 14: 'w' (found 'w'), increment `count` to `1`\n   - At position 15: '1' (not 'w'), so `count = 1`\n   - At position 16: 'i' (not 'w'), so `count = 1`\n   - At position 17: '0' (not 'w'), so `count = 1`\n   - At position 18: 'i' (not 'w'), so `count = 1`\n   - At position 19: '0' (not 'w'), so `count = 1`\n   - At position 20: 'i' (not 'w'), so `count = 1`\n   - At position 21: '1' (not 'w'), so `count = 1`\n   - At position 22: 'w' (found 'w'), increment `count` to `2`\n   - At position 23: '1' (not 'w'), so `count = 2`\n   - At position 24: 'i' (not 'w'), so `count = 2`\n   - At position 25: '1' (not 'w'), so `count = 2`\n   - At position 26: 'i' (not 'w'), so `count = 2`\n   - At position 27: '0' (not 'w'), so `count = 2`\n   - At position 28: 'r' (not 'w'), so `count = 2`\n   - At position 29: '0' (not 'w'), so `count = 2`\n\n4. When the character is not 'w' and `count` equals `index`, return the character at `index`.\n\nAt position 29 (`index = 29`), `count = 2`, and the character is '0'. Therefore, the output digit is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
