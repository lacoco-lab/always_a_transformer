Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. Continue iterating until `index` is greater than or equal to the length of the string minus 1 (to avoid going out of bounds).\n5. The digit at the position `index` (considering 0-based indexing) is the answer.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w1r1i0i0w1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i0r\n```\n\nFollowing the steps:\n\n1. `index = 0`\n2. Iterate from right to left:\n   - `w` at position 16 -> `index = 1`\n   - `r` at position 15 -> `index = 2`\n   - `i` at position 14 -> `index = 3`\n   - `0` at position 13 -> `index = 4`\n   - `w` at position 12 -> `index = 5`\n   - `r` at position 11 -> `index = 6`\n   - `1` at position 10 -> `index = 7`\n   - `i` at position 9 -> `index = 8`\n   - `0` at position 8 -> `index = 9`\n   - `w` at position 7 -> `index = 10`\n   - `r` at position 6 -> `index = 11`\n   - `1` at position 5 -> `index = 12`\n   - `i` at position 4 -> `index = 13`\n   - `0` at position 3 -> `index = 14`\n   - `i` at position 2 -> `index = 15`\n   - `0` at position 1 -> `index = 16`\n   - `r` at position 0 -> `index = 17` (exceeds string length, so stop here)\n\nSince `index = 16`, the digit at this position in the 0-based index is `0`.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
