The string contains a mix of characters and digits, with 'w' being the specific delimiter.\n\n2. **Iterate through the string**: We will iterate through the string from right to left (since we are looking for the digit after the rightmost 'w').\n\n3. **Check for 'w'**: For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, we move to the next character.\n\n4. **Extract the digit**: Once we pass the rightmost 'w', we extract the next digit.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    input_list = list(input_string)\n    \n    # Iterate from the end of the list to the beginning\n    for i in range(len(input_list) - 1, -1, -1):\n        # Check if the current character is 'w'\n        if input_list[i] == 'w':\n            # Move to the next character\n            continue\n        # If we've passed the rightmost 'w', extract the digit\n        if input_list[i].isdigit():\n            return int(input_list[i])\n    # If no digit is found after the rightmost 'w', return 0\n    return 0\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w1i1i1i0r1i1w0i1r0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0r0r0w0r0i1i1w0i1i0r0i1i0i1r1r1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r1w0i1i0i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0r0w1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i1w0r0i0r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0w1r1i1r1i1i0w1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0w1i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i1w0r0i0w0w0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0r0r0i1w1i1i0r1r1i1r1w1i1i0i1r1i0i1i0w1i0w1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i0r1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r\"\n\n# Execute the function\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
