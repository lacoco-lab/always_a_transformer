Iterate through the string starting from the end (rightmost character) until the current character is not 'w'.\n4. Increment `count` each time we encounter a 'w'.\n5. Once we reach the end of the string without finding another 'w', print the digit at the position `index` (which is `count`).\n6. If we find another 'w' before reaching the end, continue counting.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1w0i1i0i0w0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0r0i0i0i1i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i0r0i0r\"\n\n# Initialize variables\nindex = -1  # Start from the end of the string\ncount = 0   # Initialize count of 'w'\n\n# Iterate from the end of the string\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        count += 1\n    else:\n        break  # Exit loop when non-'w' character is found\n\n# The digit at the rightmost 'w' is at index 'count'\noutput_digit = str(count + 1)  # Convert to string since count might be 0\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
