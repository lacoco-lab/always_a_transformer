The string contains a repeating pattern of characters and digits.\n\n2. **Understand the repeating pattern**: The repeating unit in the string is \"w1r1w1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i0\". This unit repeats multiple times in the string.\n\n3. **Determine the position of the 'w' character**: We need to find the position of the rightmost 'w' in each repeating unit.\n\n4. **Calculate the offset**: Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', we calculate the index of the digit after it by adding 1 (since we are looking for the character **after** 'w').\n\n5. **Extract the digit**: Finally, we extract the digit at the calculated index from the repeating unit.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Length of the repeating unit\n    unit_length = len(\"w1r1w1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i0\")\n\n    # Find the position of the rightmost 'w' in the repeating unit\n    for i in range(unit_length):\n        if input_string[i: i + unit_length] == \"w1r1w1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i0\":\n            rightmost_w_index = i + 1  # +1 to get the position after 'w'\n            break\n\n    # Calculate the index of the digit after the rightmost 'w' in the full string\n    full_string_length = len(input_string)\n    offset = (full_string_length - rightmost_w_index) % unit_length\n\n    # Extract the digit at the calculated index from the repeating unit\n    repeating_unit = \"w1r1w1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i0\"\n    digit = repeating_unit[offset]\n\n    return digit\n\ninput_string = \"w1r1w1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i0r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i1w0i0i0r0i1i1i0i0w0i0i1w0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0i1i0i0r0i0i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i1w1r1i0i1i0i0i0w1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i1i0i0i0w1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0w0i1r0i0w1i0i1r1i0i1r1w1r1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1r1r1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0\"\n\n# Execute the function to get the output\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
