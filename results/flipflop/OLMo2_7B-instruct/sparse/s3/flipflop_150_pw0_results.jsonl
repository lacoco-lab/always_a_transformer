Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n4. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `count`.\n5. When 'w' is encountered, determine the position relative to the last 'w' by subtracting `count` from the current `index`.\n6. Return the digit at the calculated position.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    index = len(input_string) - 1\n    count = 0\n    while index >= 0 and input_string[index] != 'w':\n        index -= 1\n        count += 1\n    if count == 0:\n        return '0'  # If no 'w' found, return 0\n    else:\n        return input_string[index - 1]  # Return the digit at the calculated position\n\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0w0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0w0i1i1r0r0i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0w0i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1w1i1i1i0i0r\"\noutput = find_digit_after_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
