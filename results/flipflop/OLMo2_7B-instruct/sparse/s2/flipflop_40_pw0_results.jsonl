If the character is not 'w', decrement `index`.\n6. When 'index' becomes negative, it means we have passed the rightmost 'w'. The next character is the one we are looking for.\n7. Return the character at the current `index`.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i0i1i1r\n```\n\nFollowing the steps:\n\n1. `index = length(string) - 1` (since we start from the end)\n2. `count = 0` (initialize count of 'w')\n3. Iterate from the end:\n   - The last character 'r' is not 'w', so `index -= 1`\n   - The character before 'r' is 'i', so `index -= 1`\n   - The character before 'i' is '1', so `index -= 1`\n   - The character before '1' is 'i', so `index -= 1`\n   - The character before 'i' is '0', so `index -= 1`\n   - The character before '0' is '1', so `index -= 1`\n   - The character before '1' is 'i', so `index -= 1`\n   - The character before 'i' is '0', so `index -= 1`\n   - The character before '0' is 'i', so `index -= 1`\n   - The character before 'i' is '1', so `index -= 1`\n   - The character before '1' is 'i', so `index -= 1`\n   - The character before 'i' is '0', so `index -= 1`\n   - The character before '0' is 'r', which is not 'w', so `index = -4`\n\nSince `index` is negative, we stop here.\n\nThe character at index `-4` in the original string is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
