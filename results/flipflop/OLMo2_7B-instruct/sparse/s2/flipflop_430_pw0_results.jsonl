The string contains a repeating pattern of characters and digits.\n\n2. **Understand the repeating pattern**: The repeating pattern is \"w1i1w1i1\" followed by a sequence of \"0\"s and then \"r1r1i0\". This pattern repeats multiple times.\n\n3. **Determine the length of one pattern**: The length of one complete \"w1i1w1i1\" pattern plus the \"0\"s and \"r1r1i0\" is 11 characters.\n\n4. **Find the position of the rightmost 'w'**: To find the rightmost 'w', we need to determine the position of the last 'w' in the string and then count back 11 characters from that position.\n\n5. **Extract the digit after the rightmost 'w'**: Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', we extract the character at that position and determine if it is a '0' or '1'.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Find the position of the last 'w'\n    last_w_pos = input_string.rfind('w')\n    \n    # If there is no 'w', return -1 (indicating no valid 'w' found)\n    if last_w_pos == -1:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Count back 11 characters from the last 'w' position\n    offset = 11\n    digit_pos = last_w_pos - offset\n    \n    # Check if the position is valid (within the string)\n    if 0 <= digit_pos < len(input_string):\n        # Extract the character at the digit position\n        digit = input_string[digit_pos]\n        # Convert the character to a digit (0 or 1)\n        if digit == '0':\n            return '0'\n        else:\n            return '1'\n    else:\n        return -1  # No valid 'w' found or out of string bounds\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w1w1i1i0i1w1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r1r1i0w0i0i1i0i0i0i0w0i1i1w0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r1r1i0i0i0i1w0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r\"\n\n# Find and print the digit after the rightmost 'w'\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(output_digit) + \"</answer>"}

Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, if it is 'w', increment the counter.\n4. When the character is not 'w', print the digit in the counter and reset the counter to 0.\n5. Continue this process until the entire string has been processed.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0w0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i1w1r1r1i0i1i0i1r1i1i0w0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r0w1w1i0i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i1i1w0r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i1i0w0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1w0i0i1i0r0i1w1i1i0i1r\"\n\ncounter = 0\noutput_digit = \"\"\n\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        counter += 1\n    else:\n        output_digit = str(counter)\n        counter = 0\n\n    if counter > 0:\n        output_digit += '0'  # Pad with zeros if necessary\n\noutput = <answer>{output_digit}</answer>"}
