For each iteration, increment `index` by 1.\n4. Check if the character at the current position `index` is 'w'. If it is, return the digit at the position `index + 1` (since we are looking for the digit after the rightmost 'w').\n5. If no 'w' is found, return 0 as there is no digit after the rightmost 'w'.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(input_string) and input_string[index] != 'w':\n        index += 1\n    if index < len(input_string):\n        return int(input_string[index + 1])\n    else:\n        return 0\n\ninput_string = \"w1i0i0r1i0i1i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1r\"\noutput = find_digit_after_w(input_string)\n<answer>1</answer>"}
