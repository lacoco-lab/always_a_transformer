The character at index 14 (`1`) is not 'w', so increment `index` to 15 (`i0`).\n4. The character at index 15 (`0`) is not 'w', so increment `index` to 16 (`i1`).\n5. The character at index 16 (`1`) is 'w', so reset `index` to 17 (`i0`).\n6. Continue iterating: `i0` (index 17), `i0` (index 18), `i0` (index 19), `i0` (index 20), `i0` (index 21), `i0` (index 22), `i0` (index 23), `i0` (index 24), `r1` (index 25), `i1` (index 26), `0` (index 27), `i1` (index 28), `r1` (index 29), `i0` (index 30), `i0` (index 31), `r1` (index 32).\n\nThe character at index 30 (`i0`) is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
