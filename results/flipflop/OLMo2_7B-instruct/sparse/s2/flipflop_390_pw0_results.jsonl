Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of 'w' characters encountered.\n2. Iterate through the input string character by character, starting from the end.\n3. Increment the counter each time a 'w' character is found.\n4. When the counter reaches a multiple of 2 (i.e., 2, 4, 6, ...), return the character at the current position in the string.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    # Initialize counter for 'w' characters\n    w_count = 0\n    # Iterate through the string from the end\n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            w_count += 1\n        # Check if the count is a multiple of 2\n        if w_count % 2 == 0:\n            # Return the character at the current position\n            return char\n\n# Input string\ninput_string = \"w0i0r0w0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i1w0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w0i0r0w0i0i1i1w0w0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0w1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i1i1w0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1w0i1i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i0w0i1i0i1i1i0i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1r0i0w0i1i0i0i1i0r0r\"\n\n# Execute the function with the input string\nresult = find_digit_after_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
