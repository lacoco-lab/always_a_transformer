The string contains a repeating pattern of '0's and 'i's followed by 'w', and then another sequence of '0's and 'i's.\n\n2. **Determine the length of one pattern**: The repeating pattern is \"0i0i1i0i0i1\" followed by 'w'. The length of this pattern is 7 characters.\n\n3. **Find the position of the last 'w'**: We need to find the index of the last 'w' in the string.\n\n4. **Calculate the position of the required digit**: Once we have the index of the last 'w', we calculate the position of the digit immediately after it by adding 7 (the length of the pattern) to that index.\n\n5. **Extract the digit**: Finally, we extract the digit at the calculated position from the string.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_last_w(input_string):\n    # Find the index of the last 'w'\n    last_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n    \n    # If there is no 'w', return -1 (or any appropriate indicator)\n    if last_w_index == -1:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Calculate the position of the digit after the last 'w'\n    digit_position = last_w_index + 7\n    \n    # Extract the digit\n    if 0 <= digit_position <= len(input_string):\n        return input_string[digit_position]\n    else:\n        return -1  # or any appropriate indicator for out-of-bounds index\n\ninput_string = \"w0i0i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0i0i1ir0r0w1i0i1r1r1i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0w1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1w1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1w1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r\"\n    \noutput_digit = find_digit_after_last_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}

The string contains a repeating pattern of 'w0i1i0' followed by 'w0i0i1i0'.\n\n2. **Determine the length of one pattern**: The pattern 'w0i1i0w0i0i1i0' has a length of 8 characters.\n\n3. **Find the position of the last 'w'**: We need to find the position of the rightmost 'w' in the string. This can be done by iterating through the string and counting the occurrences of 'w' until we find the last one.\n\n4. **Calculate the position of the required digit**: Once we have the position of the last 'w', we calculate the position of the digit immediately after it by adding 1 to the position of the 'w'.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_last_w(input_string):\n    # Find the position of the last 'w'\n    last_w_pos = input_string.rfind('w')\n    \n    # If there is no 'w', return -1\n    if last_w_pos == -1:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Calculate the position of the digit after the last 'w'\n    digit_pos = last_w_pos + 1\n    \n    # Ensure the position is within the string bounds\n    if digit_pos >= len(input_string):\n        return -1\n    \n    # Return the digit at the calculated position\n    return input_string[digit_pos]\n\ninput_string = \"w0i1i0w0i0i1i0w0i1i0i1i0w1r0w1r1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r1i0i0w1i1i1w1r1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0w0i0i0w0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0w1i1r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1r1i1w1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1i1i1i1i1i0w0i0i1i1r0r0w0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1r1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i0r1i0r1i1w0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i1w1i1i0i1r1w\"\n    output_digit = find_digit_after_last_w(input_string)\n    if output_digit == -1:\n        print(\"<no digit>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"<answer>\" + str(output_digit) + \"</answer>"}
