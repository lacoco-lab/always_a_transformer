Continue iterating until the end of the string.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w0i1i1w0i1w0i1i1i0w0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r0w1i1i1i1r\n```\n\nFollowing the steps:\n\n1. Initialize `index` to `0`.\n2. Start iterating from the end of the string:\n   - The last character is 'r', so `index` remains `0`.\n   - The character before 'r' is 'i', so `index` becomes `1`.\n   - The character before 'i' is '0', so `index` remains `1`.\n   - The character before '0' is 'i', so `index` becomes `2`.\n   - The character before 'i' is '1', so `index` becomes `3`.\n   - The character before '1' is 'i', so `index` becomes `4`.\n   - The character before 'i' is '1', so `index` becomes `5`.\n   - The character before '1' is 'i', so `index` becomes `6`.\n   - The character before 'i' is '0', so `index` becomes `7`.\n   - The character before '0' is 'w', so `index` becomes `8`.\n   - The character before 'w' is '0', so `index` remains `8`.\n\nSince the current character is 'w' and `index` is `8`, the rightmost 'w' character is at the 8th position from the end of the string.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is the digit at position `8`, which is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
