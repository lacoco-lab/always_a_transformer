Initialize `index` to 0.\n2. Start iterating from the second character ('i') of the string.\n3. The first 'w' is encountered at index 2, increment `index` to 3.\n4. The next 'w' is encountered at index 7, increment `index` to 8.\n5. The next characters are 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'r', '0', 'i', '0', 'w', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0' (ignoring 'w').\n\nAt index 8, the character is '0'. Since `index` is now 8 and we are looking for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w', we need to consider `index - w` where `w` is 3.\n\nSo, `index - w = 8 - 3 = 5`.\n\nThe character at index 5 is 'i'.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w', which means we should consider the position relative to the last 'w'. Since the last 'w' is at index 13, we need to look at index 14 (as index is zero-based).\n\nThe character at index 14 is 'r'.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n<answer>4</answer>"}
