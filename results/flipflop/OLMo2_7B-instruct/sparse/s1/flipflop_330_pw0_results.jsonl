The string contains a repeating pattern of '0's and '1's followed by 'w', and then another sequence of '0's and '1's.\n\n2. **Determine the length of one pattern**: The repeating pattern consists of 13 characters: '1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', 'w', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', 'w'.\n\n3. **Find the position of the rightmost 'w'**: Since the pattern repeats every 13 characters, we need to find the position of the rightmost 'w' in the given string. This can be done by calculating the remainder of the string's length divided by 13.\n\n4. **Extract the digit after the rightmost 'w'**: Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', we can extract the character at that position and determine if it is a '0' or '1'.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Length of one pattern\n    pattern_length = 13\n    \n    # Find the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    rightmost_w_position = (len(input_string) - 1) % pattern_length\n    \n    # Extract the digit after the rightmost 'w'\n    if rightmost_w_position < 0:\n        rightmost_w_position += pattern_length\n    \n    # The character at the rightmost 'w' position\n    character_after_w = input_string[rightmost_w_position]\n    \n    # Return the digit (0 or 1) after the 'w'\n    return character_after_w\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1w1r1w0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1w0i1i0i0w0i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1w1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i0w0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1r\"\n\n# Execute the function\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
