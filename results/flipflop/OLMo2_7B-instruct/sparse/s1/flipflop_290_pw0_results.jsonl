The string contains a repeating pattern of characters and digits.\n\n2. **Understand the repeating pattern**: The repeating unit in the string is \"i1i0r1i0i0r1i1i0\". This unit repeats multiple times followed by \"w0r0i1i1i0i1i1r0\".\n\n3. **Determine the length of the repeating pattern**: The repeating unit \"i1i0r1i0i0r1i1i0\" has a length of 8 characters.\n\n4. **Find the position of the rightmost 'w'**: Since the repeating unit is 8 characters long, every full cycle of the repeating unit will end with a 'w' at the 9th position (0-indexed).\n\n5. **Calculate the position of the rightmost 'w' in the entire string**: \n   - The entire string is composed of multiple repetitions of the repeating unit plus the trailing \"w0r0i1i1i0i1i1r0\".\n   - Let's denote the number of full cycles of the repeating unit as \\( n \\).\n   - The length of the entire string is \\( 8n + 10 \\) (since each cycle is 8 characters long and there are 10 characters after the last 'w' in the repeating unit).\n\n6. **Find \\( n \\)**: \n   - The rightmost 'w' in the repeating unit occurs at position 9.\n   - The rightmost 'w' in the entire string occurs at position \\( 9 + 8n \\).\n\n7. **Determine \\( n \\)**: \n   - The rightmost 'w' in the entire string must be the last 'w' in the string.\n   - Therefore, \\( 9 + 8n = \\text{length of the string} - 10 \\).\n\n8. **Calculate the length of the string**: \n   - The string provided is quite long, and calculating the exact length manually is impractical.\n   - However, we can deduce that \\( 9 + 8n \\) must be the last position of 'w' in the string.\n\nGiven the complexity of the string and the need for an algorithmic approach, let's simplify the problem by focusing on the repeating pattern and the position calculation:\n\n- The repeating unit ends with 'w' at position 9.\n- The entire string length is \\( 8n + 10 \\).\n- The rightmost 'w' in the string occurs at \\( 9 + 8n \\).\n\nSince the string is very long and the exact \\( n \\) is not provided, we can assume \\( n \\) is large enough that \\( 9 + 8n \\) is the last position before the trailing characters \"i1i0w0i1i1i0i1i1r0\".\n\nGiven the structure, the rightmost 'w' will be at the end of the repeating units plus the trailing characters.\n\n**Example Calculation**:\n- If \\( n = 10 \\), then \\( 9 + 8 \\times 10 = 97 \\).\n- The string length is \\( 8 \\times 10 + 10 = 90 \\).\n- The rightmost 'w' would be at position 97, which is beyond the string length.\n\nThus, the rightmost 'w' in the string is the last 'w' before the trailing characters.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n<answer>0</answer>"}
