Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of occurrences of 'w'.\n3. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n4. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `count`.\n5. When 'w' is not found, the `index` variable will hold the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n6. Return the digit at the position `index`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    count = 0\n    index = len(input_string) - 1\n    \n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            count += 1\n        if count == 1:\n            return str(input_string[index])\n    return None\n\ninput_string = \"w0i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i0r1i0r\"\noutput = find_rightmost_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
