Continue iterating until the end of the string.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0i0i1i0w0i1i1i1i0i0i0w0i0i0i1i0i1w0i1w0i1i0i0i1r\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start at the end of the string: `r`\n2. Move left: `i0i1i1i1i0i0i0w0i0i0i1i0i1w0i1w0i1i0i0i1`\n3. Find the first 'w': `w0i1i1i1i0i0i0`\n4. Increment `index`: `0i1i1i1i0i0i0`\n5. Find the character at index `0`: `0`\n\nThus, the digit after the **right most** 'w' character is `<0>`.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
