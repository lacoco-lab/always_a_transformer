The string contains a repeating pattern of characters and digits.\n\n2. **Understand the repeating pattern**: The repeating unit in the string is \"w1r1i0i0i1r1i0i1i1w1w1i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r\". This unit repeats throughout the string.\n\n3. **Determine the position of the 'w' character**: To find the rightmost 'w', we need to locate the last occurrence of 'w' in the repeating unit.\n\n4. **Calculate the position of the required digit**: Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', we can determine the index of the digit immediately following it in the repeating unit.\n\n5. **Extract the digit**: Finally, we extract the digit at the calculated index from the repeating unit.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Define the repeating pattern\n    pattern = \"w1r1i0i0i1r1i0i1i1w1w1i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r\"\n    \n    # Find the position of the last 'w' in the pattern\n    last_w_position = pattern.rindex('w')\n    \n    # The position of the required digit is last_w_position + 1 (since we need the digit after 'w')\n    required_digit_position = last_w_position + 1\n    \n    # Extract the digit at the required position from the pattern\n    required_digit = pattern[required_digit_position]\n    \n    # Return the digit\n    return required_digit\n\ninput_string = \"w1r1i0i0i1r1i0i1i1w1w1i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r\"\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
