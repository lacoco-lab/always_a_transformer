The string contains a repeating pattern of characters and digits.\n\n2. **Understand the repeating pattern**: The repeating unit in the string is \"w1i1r1w0i0i1r0\". This unit repeats multiple times.\n\n3. **Determine the position of the 'w' character**: We need to find the position of the rightmost 'w' in each repeating unit.\n\n4. **Calculate the offset**: Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', we calculate the index of the digit after it by adding 1 (since we are looking for the character **after** 'w').\n\n5. **Extract the digit**: Finally, we extract the digit at the calculated index from the repeating unit.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Length of the repeating unit\n    unit_length = 7  # \"w1i1r1w0i0i1r0\" has 7 characters\n\n    # Find the position of the rightmost 'w' in the repeating unit\n    for i in range(unit_length - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_string[i: i + 7] == \"w1i1r1w0i0i1r0\":\n            rightmost_w_index = i\n            break\n\n    # Calculate the index of the digit after the rightmost 'w'\n    digit_index = rightmost_w_index + 1\n\n    # Extract the digit from the repeating unit\n    repeating_unit = \"w1i1r1w0i0i1r0\"\n    digit = repeating_unit[digit_index % unit_length]\n\n    return digit\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w1i1i1r1w0i0i1r0i1i1i0r0w0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1w0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i0i0i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i0i0r1i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1i0i1r1i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1r1i0i0r1w1r1i1i1w1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i0i0r1i1i0r1r1i1i1i0r1i0i1i0i1w1i1i0r\"\n\n# Find and print the digit after the rightmost 'w'\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(output_digit) + \"</answer>"}

Let's count the number of characters in one complete pattern:\n   - The pattern starts with '0' or '1', which we'll consider as 1 character.\n   - Then comes 'w', which is 1 character.\n   - So, one complete pattern has 2 characters.\n\n3. **Find the position of the rightmost 'w'**: To find the rightmost 'w', we need to determine the position of the last 'w' in the string. This can be done by iterating through the string from the end and counting the occurrences of 'w'.\n\n4. **Determine the digit after the rightmost 'w'**: Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', we can find the digit immediately after it by indexing into the string from that position.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Find the position of the last 'w' in the string\n    last_w_position = input_string.rfind('w')\n    \n    # If there is no 'w', return -1 (or any appropriate indicator)\n    if last_w_position == -1:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Find the position of the character immediately after the last 'w'\n    digit_after_w = last_w_position + 1\n    \n    # Ensure the index is within the bounds of the string\n    if digit_after_w >= len(input_string):\n        return -1\n    \n    # Return the character at the calculated position\n    return input_string[digit_after_w]\n\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i0i1w0r0i1i1i1w0w0w0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r0r0i0i1i1i0w0i1i1i1i0i0w1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i0i0w1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i1r0i0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i0i1i1r0i0i1r0w1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i0i0w1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0r\"\n    output_digit = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\n    if output_digit == -1:\n        print(\"<no digit>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"<answer>\" + str(output_digit) + \"</answer>"}
