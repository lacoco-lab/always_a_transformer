The string contains a repeating pattern of characters and digits.\n\n2. **Understand the repeating pattern**: The repeating unit in the string is \"w1i1r1r1i1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i1\". This unit repeats multiple times.\n\n3. **Determine the length of the repeating unit**: The repeating unit \"w1i1r1r1i1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i1\" has a length of 12 characters.\n\n4. **Find the position of the rightmost 'w'**: To find the rightmost 'w', we need to determine the position of the last occurrence of 'w' in the string. This can be done by calculating the length of the string and then finding the remainder when this length is divided by the length of the repeating unit.\n\n5. **Extract the digit after the rightmost 'w'**: Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', we can extract the digit at that position from the repeating unit.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Length of the repeating unit\n    repeating_unit_length = 12\n    \n    # Length of the input string\n    input_string_length = len(input_string)\n    \n    # Find the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    rightmost_w_position = (input_string_length - 1) % repeating_unit_length\n    \n    # Extract the digit after the rightmost 'w' from the repeating unit\n    repeating_unit = \"w1i1r1r1i1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i1\"\n    digit_after_rightmost_w = repeating_unit[rightmost_w_position]\n    \n    return digit_after_rightmost_w\n\ninput_string = \"w1i1w1i1r1r1i1i1i1i0r1r1i0i0i1i1w1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i1r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i1i0i0i0i1r0w1i0i1i1i0i0i1r1w1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i1i0w0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1w1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0w1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i0w0i1i1i0i0i0i1r0w1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r1w0r0i0i1r0i1r0r0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i0w1i0i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r\"\n    \noutput_digit = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
