In zero-based indexing, this would be the character at index `14`.\n\nThe character at index `14` is 'r'.\n\nTherefore, the output digit is:\n\n<answer>4</answer>"}

Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. Continue iterating until `index` is greater than or equal to the length of the string minus 1 (to avoid going out of bounds).\n5. The digit at the position `index` (0-indexed) is the answer.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w1i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1w0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i0w0i1i0i0i0w0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0r\n```\n\nUsing the algorithm:\n\n1. Start at the end of the string: `r0`\n2. The character is not 'w', so `index` remains 0.\n3. Move to the next character: `i0`\n4. The character is not 'w', so `index` remains 0.\n5. Continue this process until we reach the beginning of the string.\n\nAfter following the steps, we find that the digit at index 0 is `0`.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
