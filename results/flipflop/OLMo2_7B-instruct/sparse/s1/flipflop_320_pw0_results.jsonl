The string contains a mix of digits and 'w' characters, with a specific pattern where 'w' is followed by a digit.\n\n2. **Understand the pattern**: The pattern is such that 'w' is followed by a digit, and this sequence repeats. For example, \"w1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1w1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i1w1i0r1w0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i1i1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w1i1i0i0i1i1r\"\n\n3. **Extract the repeating sequence**: The repeating sequence is \"w followed by a digit\".

The character 'w' appears 24 times, and 'r' appears 29 times. Our goal is to find the digit after the **rightmost** 'w'.\n\n2. **String Structure**: The string is structured in a way that 'r' characters are interspersed among 'w' characters. There are no other characters.\n\n3. **Determine the Position**: Since we need the digit after the **rightmost** 'w', we need to find the position of the last 'w' in the string.\n\n4. **Calculate the Position**: We can calculate the position of the last 'w' by:\n   - Counting the number of 'r' characters until we reach the end of the string.\n   - Adding 1 to this count to get the position of the 'w' immediately after the last 'r'.\n\n5. **Extract the Digit**: Once we have the position of the last 'w', we extract the digit at that position from the input string.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Count the number of 'r' characters\n    r_count = input_string.count('r')\n    \n    # The position of the last 'w' is one more than the count of 'r'\n    position_of_last_w = r_count + 1\n    \n    # Extract the digit after the last 'w'\n    last_w_position = input_string.rfind('w', position_of_last_w)\n    if last_w_position != -1:\n        return str(input_string[last_w_position])\n    else:\n        return '0'  # Return '0' if there is no 'w' after the last 'r'\n\n# Input string\ninput_string = \"w1i0i0i1r1r1w1w1i1i0i0r1i0i1i1i0i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i0w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0r0i0i1w0r0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1w1r1i1i1i0w0r0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0i1r0r0i0w1i0r1i0i1r1r1w0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i0r0w0r0i0i1r0i1i0i0i0w0i0i0i1i0w0w0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i0r0r0w0i0i0i1i0i1i1r\"\n\n# Find and print the digit after the rightmost 'w'\nanswer = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\nprint(\"<answer>\" + answer + \"</answer>"}

The string contains a repeating pattern of characters and digits.\n\n2. **Understand the repeating pattern**: The repeating unit in the string is \"w1w1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r1w1r1i0i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1i0i1i0r1i0r1\". This unit repeats throughout the string.\n\n3. **Determine the position of 'w' within the repeating unit**: The rightmost 'w' in each repeating unit is at the 21st position (0-indexed).\n\n4. **Extract the digit after the rightmost 'w'**: Since the repeating unit is 32 characters long, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' in each unit is the 33rd character (0-indexed) of that unit.\n\n5. **Calculate the position in the entire string**: Given that the repeating unit is 32 characters long, we need to find the position of the 33rd character in the entire string.\n\n6. **Implement the solution in code**: We will use Python to extract the required character from the string.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the repeating unit\nrepeating_unit = \"w1w1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r1w1r1i0i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1i0i1i0r\"\n\n# Length of the repeating unit\nunit_length = len(repeating_unit)\n\n# The rightmost 'w' is at position 21 (0-indexed) in the repeating unit\nrightmost_w_position = 21\n\n# The digit after the rightmost 'w' in the repeating unit is at position 22 (0-indexed)\ndigit_after_w = rightmost_w_position + 1\n\n# Calculate the position in the entire string\n# The entire string is composed of multiple repeating units\n# Let's assume the entire string is composed of 'n' repeating units\n# We need to find the position of the 33rd character in the entire string\n# Position in the entire string = (digit_after_w - 1) * unit_length + 1\n# We need to determine 'n' such that the position is within the bounds of the string\n\n# Let's assume the entire string is composed of 'n' repeating units\n# The total length of the string is n * unit_length\n# We need to find the largest 'n' such that (digit_after_w - 1) * unit_length + 1 <= string_length\n\n# Since the exact length of the string is not provided, let's assume a reasonable length for demonstration\n# Let's assume the string length is 100 repeating units for demonstration\nn = 100\n\n# Calculate the position in the entire string\nposition_in_string = (digit_after_w - 1) * unit_length + 1\n\n# Extract the digit\noutput_digit = string[position_in_string]\n\n# Print the output digit\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(output_digit) + \"</answer>"}

The string contains a mix of digits and 'w' characters, with a repeating pattern of 'w', followed by a sequence of '1's, then a '0', and repeating this sequence multiple times.\n\n2. **Determine the length of one pattern**: The pattern consists of 'w', '1', '1', '1', '0'. This pattern repeats every 5 characters.\n\n3. **Find the position of the rightmost 'w'**: To find the rightmost 'w', we need to locate the last occurrence of 'w' in the string.\n\n4. **Calculate the position of the required digit**: Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', we calculate the position of the digit immediately after it by adding 5 (the length of the pattern) to this position.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Find the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    rightmost_w_pos = len(input_string) - 1 - input_string.rfind('w')\n\n    # Calculate the position of the digit after the rightmost 'w'\n    digit_pos = rightmost_w_pos + 5\n\n    # Ensure the position is within the bounds of the string\n    if 0 <= digit_pos <= len(input_string):\n        return str(input_string[digit_pos])\n    else:\n        return \"No digit after the rightmost 'w'\"\n\ninput_string = \"w1r1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1r1i1i0w1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i1i0r1r1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i1i1w0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i1r0w1i1w1r1r1r1i1i1i1w0r0i1w1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1r1i0w0i0r0i1i1i1i0w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0w0i0i0w0i1r\"\n    \noutput = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
