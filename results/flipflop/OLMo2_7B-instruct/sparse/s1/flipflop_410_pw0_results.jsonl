If it is, we need to find the digit immediately after it.\n\n4. **Extract the digit**: Once we find a 'w', we extract the next character (which is the digit) and return it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through the string from the rightmost end\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n        # Check if the current character is 'w'\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            # If it is 'w', append the next character to the result\n            result += input_string[i + 1]\n    \n    # Return the result (the digit after the rightmost 'w')\n    return result\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1r0i0i1r0w1i0i0i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1r\"\n\n# Find and print the digit after the rightmost 'w'\nanswer = <answer>\nprint(answer)  # This will output '0'\n```\n\nThe digit after the rightmost 'w' in the given string is `0`. Thus, the final answer is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
