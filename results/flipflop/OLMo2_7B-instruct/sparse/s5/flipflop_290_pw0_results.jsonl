The string contains a repeating pattern of characters and digits.\n\n2. **Understand the repeating pattern**: The repeating unit in the string is \"w0w0r0i0i1i1w0i1i0i1w0\". This unit repeats throughout the string.\n\n3. **Determine the position of the 'w' character**: To find the rightmost 'w', we need to calculate the position of each 'w' in the repeating unit and then determine the rightmost one.\n\n4. **Calculate the position**: The repeating unit has a length of 12 characters. We need to find the position of the rightmost 'w' within this unit.\n\n5. **Extract the digit after the rightmost 'w'**: Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', we can extract the digit that follows it.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Length of the repeating unit\n    unit_length = 12\n    \n    # Find the position of the rightmost 'w'\n    for i in range(len(input_string) - unit_length + 1):\n        if input_string[i:i+unit_length].strip('w') == 'w0w0r0i0i1i1w0i1i0i1':\n            rightmost_w_position = i\n            break\n    \n    # Extract the digit after the rightmost 'w'\n    digit_after_w = input_string[rightmost_w_position + unit_length : rightmost_w_position + unit_length + 1]\n    return int(digit_after_w)\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w0w0r0i0i1i1w0i1i0i1w0r0i1i1i0r0r0r0i1i0w0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0r0i0i1i1i0w1i1r1r1i0w1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0r1r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i1w0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r\"\n\n# Find and print the digit after the rightmost 'w'\nanswer = <answer>5</answer>"}
