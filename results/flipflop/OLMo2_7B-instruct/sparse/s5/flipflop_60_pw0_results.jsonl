Initialize `index = 0` and `count = 0`.\n2. Iterate from the rightmost character:\n   - Character at index 19 is 'r'.\n   - Character at index 18 is 'i'.\n   - Character at index 17 is '0'.\n   - Character at index 16 is 'i'.\n   - Character at index 15 is '1'.\n   - Character at index 14 is 'w'.\n   - Character at index 13 is '0'.\n   - Character at index 12 is 'r'.\n   - Character at index 11 is '0'.\n   - Character at index 10 is 'r'.\n   - Character at index 9 is '0'.\n   - Character at index 8 is 'r'.\n   - Character at index 7 is '0'.\n   - Character at index 6 is 'r'.\n   - Character at index 5 is 'w'.\n   - Character at index 4 is '0'.\n   - Character at index 3 is 'r'.\n   - Character at index 2 is '0'.\n   - Character at index 1 is 'i'.\n   - Character at index 0 is 'w'.\n\n3. Increment `index` for each character: `index = 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0`.\n4. Count the number of 'w' characters: `count = 2` (since there are two 'w' characters before the last 'r').\n\n5. Find the position after the last 'w': `index - count = 0 - 2 = -2`.\n\nSince `index - count` results in a negative number, it indicates that the rightmost 'w' is the last character in the string. Therefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is the character at index `-2`, which is `None` (indicating the end of the string).\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the **rightmost** 'w' and the task implies finding the digit after it, we should consider the position relative to the last 'w'. The rightmost 'w' is at index 15, and since `count` is 2, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is the character at `15 - 2 = 13`, which is '0'.\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
