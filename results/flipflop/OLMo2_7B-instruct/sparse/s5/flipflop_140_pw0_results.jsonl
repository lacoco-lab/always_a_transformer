Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Iterate through the input string from the rightmost character.\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment the counter.\n4. When the character is not 'w', print the digit corresponding to the current counter value (0 or 1) and reset the counter to 0.\n5. Continue this process until the entire string has been processed.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1w1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1w1i0i0r1i0i1i1r1i1i0i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0w1r1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i1i0i1w0i1i1r0i0r0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1r\"\n\n# Initialize counter and index\ncounter = 0\nindex = len(input_string) - 1\n\n# Process the string from right to left\nwhile index >= 0:\n    if input_string[index] == 'w':\n        counter += 1\n    else:\n        print('<answer>' + str(counter) + '</answer>"}
