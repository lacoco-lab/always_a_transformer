Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character until the `index` is less than the length of the string.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment `index` by 1.\n4. If the current character is not 'w', print the digit at the current `index` position (0 or 1).\n5. After the loop, if there are any remaining characters to the right of the last 'w', print the digit at the last valid `index`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0w0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1r0i0i0w0i0i1w0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i0w0i0i0w0i0i1i1i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i1r\"\n\n# Initialize index\nindex = 0\n\n# Iterate from the rightmost character\nwhile index < len(input_string):\n    if input_string[index] == 'w':\n        index += 1\n    else:\n        # Print the digit at the current index\n        print(int(input_string[index]))\n        index += 1\n\n# If there are characters after the last 'w', print the digit at the last valid index\nif index < len(input_string):\n    print(int(input_string[index]))\n</answer>"}
