So, the total length of one complete pattern is \\(4 + 9 + 2 = 15\\) characters.\n\n3. **Find the position of the rightmost 'w'**: To find the rightmost 'w', we need to determine the position of the last occurrence of 'w' in the string. This can be done by iterating through the string from the end and counting the 'w' characters until we find the last one.\n\n4. **Calculate the position of the required digit**: Once we have the position of the rightmost 'w', we need to find the digit immediately after it. This can be done by calculating the index of the character right after the rightmost 'w' by adding 1 to the position of the 'w'.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Find the position of the last 'w' character\n    last_w_position = input_string.rfind('w')\n    \n    # If there is no 'w', return 0\n    if last_w_position == -1:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Calculate the position of the digit after the rightmost 'w'\n    digit_position = last_w_position + 1\n    \n    # Extract the digit at the calculated position\n    digit = input_string[digit_position]\n    \n    return digit\n\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1i0w0w0i1i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0r\"\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
