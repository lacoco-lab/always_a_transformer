Start at the end of the string: `r1i1i0i1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i1i1r`\n2. Find the first 'w': `w1`\n   - `index` is now 6\n3. Move to the next character: `i0`\n   - `index` is now 7\n4. Find the next 'w': `w1`\n   - `index` is now 8\n5. Move to the next character: `i0`\n   - `index` is now 9\n6. Find the next 'w': `w1`\n   - `index` is now 10\n7. Move to the next character: `r`\n   - `index` is now 11\n8. Since `index` is greater than `w` (which is 10), we stop here.\n\nThe character at index 10 is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
