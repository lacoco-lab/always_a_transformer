Return the digit at the `index` position in the string.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i0i1r1i0i1i1i0w1i0i0i0i1i1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0w1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i0r1i0w0i0i1i0i1i0w0i0i1i0r0i1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r1i1w0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1w1i0r1i0r1i1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i1w0i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i1r0i0i1w1i0r1i1i0i1i1w1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0r1i1r1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r1r1i0i1i0w1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i0w1r1w0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1r\"\n\nindex = 0\nfor char in input_string:\n    if char == 'w':\n        index += 1\n    if index == len(input_string):\n        break\n\nanswer = str(input_string[index])\nprint(answer)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the digit at the rightmost position of the 'w' characters in the string.
