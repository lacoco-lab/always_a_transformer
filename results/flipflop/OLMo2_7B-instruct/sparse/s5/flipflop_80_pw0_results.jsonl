Initialize a variable `index` to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string starting from the rightmost character.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If `index` is equal to `w` (the number of 'w' characters), return the character at the `index` position in the string.\n5. If the current character is not 'w', move to the next character without incrementing `index`.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0w1i1i0i1r1i1i0w0i0w0r0i0i1i0i0i0i0r\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost character and moving left:\n\n- The rightmost character is 'r', so `index = 0`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 1`.\n- The next character is 'w', so `index = 2`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 3`.\n- The next character is 'i', so `index = 4`.\n- The next character is '1', so `index = 5`.\n- The next character is 'i', so `index = 6`.\n- The next character is '1', so `index = 7`.\n- The next character is 'i', so `index = 8`.\n- The next character is '1', so `index = 9`.\n- The next character is 'i', so `index = 10`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 11`.\n- The next character is 'r', so `index = 12`.\n- The next character is '0', so `index = 13`.\n\nSince `index = 2` when the current character is 'w', the character at this position is 'i'.\n\nTherefore, the output digit is:\n\n<answer>2</answer>"}

If the character at the current `index` is 'w', reset `index` to `len(Input) + 1` (which effectively moves the pointer to the next character after the last 'w').\n5. Continue the loop until `index` is beyond the length of the string.\n6. The value at the final `index` is the digit we are looking for.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nInput = \"w0i1r0w0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0r0i1i0i1w0i1i1i0i1i0r\"\n\n# Initialize index\nindex = len(Input) - 1\n\n# Iterate from the rightmost character\nwhile index >= 0 and Input[index] == 'w':\n    index -= 1\n\n# The digit after the last 'w'\noutput_digit = Input[index]\n\n# Output the result\n<answer>0</answer>"}
