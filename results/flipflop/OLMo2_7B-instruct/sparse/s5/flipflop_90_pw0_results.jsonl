If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If the current character is not 'w', check if `index` is equal to `w`. If it is, return the digit at the current position in the string.\n5. Increment `index` to move to the next character.\n6. Repeat the process until the end of the string is reached.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string, w):\n    index = len(input_string) - 1  # Start from the rightmost character\n    current_char = input_string[-1]  # Get the rightmost character\n\n    while index >= 0 and current_char != 'w':  # Move left until we find 'w'\n        index -= 1\n        current_char = input_string[index]\n\n    if current_char == 'w':  # If the current character is 'w', increment index\n        index += 1\n\n    return input_string[index]  # Return the digit at the final position\n\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0w0r0i1i1i1w0i0i1i0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i1w1i1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r\"\nw = 5  # Given 'w' count\n\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string, w)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
