Iterate through the string starting from the second character (since we are looking for the digit after the **right most** 'w') until we find the character 'w'.\n3. For each iteration, increment the `index` by 1.\n4. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, we have found the 'w' and need to determine the digit immediately after it.\n5. Count the number of characters from the current position `index` to the end of the string.\n6. The count represents the number of characters (including spaces) after the rightmost 'w'. The actual digit will be the character at position `index + count - 1`.\n7. Return the digit found in step 6.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\nInput: w1i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0r\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    index = 1  # Start from the second character after the first 'w'\n    while input_string[index] != 'w':\n        index += 1\n    \n    count = 0  # Initialize count of characters after the 'w'\n    for char in input_string[index:]:\n        if char != ' ':\n            count += 1\n    \n    # The digit is the character at index + count - 1\n    digit = input_string[index + count - 1]\n    \n    return digit\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w1i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0r\"\n\n# Find and print the digit after the rightmost 'w'\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}

For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If the character is not 'w', check if `index` is equal to `w`. If it is, return the character at the current position (which is the digit we are looking for).\n5. Continue the loop until the end of the string.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\nInput: w1i0i0i1i1i1r1r1i0i1r1i1i0i1r\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string, w):\n    index = 1  # Start from the second character\n    for i in range(len(input_string)):\n        if input_string[i] == 'w':\n            index += 1\n        else:\n            if index == w:\n                return input_string[i]\n            index = 1  # Reset index if the character is not 'w'\n    return None  # Return None if no 'w' found or no digit after the 'w'\n\ninput_string = \"w1i0i0i1i1i1r1r1i0i1r1i1i0i1r\"\nw = 5  # Rightmost 'w' is at index 5\n\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string, w)\n<answer>0</answer>"}
