Count the number of 'i' characters encountered from the current position `index` until the end of the string.\n4. Once we encounter a 'w', add the count of 'i' characters to `index` and take the modulus with the length of the string to wrap around to the beginning if necessary.\n5. The digit at the position `index` (0-indexed) is the answer.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    # Initialize index at the rightmost character\n    index = len(input_string) - 1\n    \n    # Count 'i' characters from the rightmost 'w'\n    i_count = 0\n    for char in input_string[::-1]:  # Iterate from right to left\n        if char == 'i':\n            i_count += 1\n        elif char == 'w':\n            # Update index considering the count of 'i' characters\n            index = (index + i_count) % len(input_string)\n    \n    # The digit at the calculated index\n    return str(input_string[index])\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1w1r1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0r\"\n\n# Find and print the digit after the rightmost 'w'\noutput_digit = find_digit_after_w(input_string)\n<answer>0</answer>"}

For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `index`.\n4. If the character is not 'w', check if `index` is equal to `w`. If it is, return the character at the current position (which is the digit after the **right most** 'w').\n5. If the loop completes without finding a 'w' at the current `index`, return `None` as there is no such digit.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string, w):\n    index = 1\n    for char in input_string[1:]:\n        if char == 'w':\n            index += 1\n        else:\n            if index == w:\n                return char\n            index = 1\n    return None\n\ninput_string = \"w1i1i1i1i1i1w1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i0i1i0i0r\"\nw = 3\noutput = find_digit_after_w(input_string, w)\nprint(\"<answer>\" + output + \"</answer>"}
