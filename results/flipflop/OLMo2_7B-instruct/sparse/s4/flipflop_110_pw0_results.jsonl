Iterate through the string starting from the end (rightmost character).\n4. For each character, check if it is 'w'. If it is, increment `count`.\n5. When 'w' is not found, the `count` will give the position of the rightmost 'w' from the start of the string.\n6. Return the character at the position `count` from the start of the string.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    count = 0\n    for char in reversed(input_string):\n        if char == 'w':\n            count += 1\n    return input_string[count]\n\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1i0i0w0i1i1i0i0i1r0w1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1w1i1r1i1i1i1i0w1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i0r\"\noutput = <answer>\n```\n\nRunning the above code will give us the digit after the rightmost 'w' in the string.
