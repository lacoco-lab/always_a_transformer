Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of 'w' characters encountered.\n2. Iterate through the input string character by character.\n3. Increment the counter each time a 'w' is encountered.\n4. When the counter reaches 'w' (considering 'w' as 1 for the count), find the position of the current character in the string.\n5. Return the digit at the position corresponding to the count of 'w' characters plus one (since we start counting from 1).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1w1i1r1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0w1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i1r1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r\"\n\n# Initialize counter for 'w' characters\nw_count = 0\n\n# Find the digit after the rightmost 'w' character\nfor char in input_string:\n    if char == 'w':\n        w_count += 1\n    # Find the position of the current character (index + 1 because count starts from 1)\n    position = (w_count + 1) % len(input_string)\n    # Print the digit at the calculated position\n    answer = str(input_string[position])\n    break  # Since we need only the digit after the last 'w', we break after finding it\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
