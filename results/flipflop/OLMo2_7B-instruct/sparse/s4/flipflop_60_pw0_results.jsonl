Once 'w' is encountered, find the digit immediately to its right.\n6. Return the digit found at the `index`.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w1i0i1r1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0w0i0i1w0i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0r\n```\n\nFollowing the steps:\n\n1. `index = 1`\n2. Current character is '1', not 'w', so `index = 2`.\n3. Current character is 'r', not 'w', so `index = 3`.\n4. Current character is 'i', not 'w', so `index = 4`.\n5. Current character is '0', which is not 'w', so `index = 5`.\n6. Current character is 'w', increment `index` to `6`.\n7. The digit immediately to the right of 'w' at index `6` is '0'.\n\nThus, the output digit is `<0>` and </answer>"}

The character at the `index` position is the answer.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w1i1i1r1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i0i0w0i0r0w1w1r1i1i1i0r\n```\n\nFollowing the steps:\n\n1. Initialize `index` to `0`.\n2. Start iterating from the rightmost character (`r`).\n3. The first 'r' is at index `0`, increment `index`.\n4. The next character is 'i', so `index` is now `1`.\n5. Continue iterating: 'i', 'r', 'i', 'r', 'i', '1', '0', 'r', '0', 'w', '0', 'r', 'w', '1', 'w', '1', 'r', 'i', '1', 'i', '0' -> 'r'.\n6. The next character is 'r' at index `11` (since the string length is 21).\n7. Increment `index` to `12`.\n8. The character at index `12` is '0'.\n\nThus, the output digit is `<answer>0</answer>"}

Increment `count` to 1.\n- The next character is '1'. Increment `index` to 6.\n- The next character is 'i'. Increment `index` to 7.\n- The next character is '1'. Increment `index` to 8.\n- The next character is 'i'. Increment `index` to 9.\n- The next character is '0'. Increment `index` to 10.\n- The next character is 'w'. Increment `count` to 2.\n- The next character is '1'. Increment `index` to 11.\n- The next character is 'r'. Increment `index` to 12.\n- The next character is '1'. Increment `index` to 13.\n- The next character is 'i'. Increment `index` to 14.\n- The next character is '0'. Increment `index` to 15.\n\nSince `count` equals `w` (2), we look at the character at `index` 15, which is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the output digit is:\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
