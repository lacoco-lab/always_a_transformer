Continue iterating until the end of the string.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given input string:\n\n```\nInput: w0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i0i0r\n```\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start at the end of the string: `r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1`\n2. The first character 'r' is not 'w', so move to the next character: `0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1`\n3. The first character '0' is not 'w', so move to the next character: `i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1`\n4. The first character 'i' is not 'w', so move to the next character: `0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1`\n5. The first character '0' is not 'w', so move to the next character: `i1i0i0i0i1i1i1`\n6. The first character 'i' is not 'w', so move to the next character: `1i0i0i0i1i1i1`\n7. The first character '1' is not 'w', so move to the next character: `i0i0i0i1i1i1`\n8. The first character 'i' is not 'w', so move to the next character: `0i0i0i1i1i1`\n9. The first character '0' is not 'w', so move to the next character: `i0i0i1i1i1`\n10. The first character 'i' is not 'w', so move to the next character: `0i1`\n11. The first character '0' is not 'w', so move to the next character: `i`\n12. The character 'i' is not 'w', so print the digit at this position, which is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the output digit is: <0> \n\n</answer>"}
