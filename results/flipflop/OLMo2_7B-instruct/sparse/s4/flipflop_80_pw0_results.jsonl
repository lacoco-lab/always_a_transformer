When 'w' is encountered, determine the position relative to the last 'w' by subtracting `count` from the current `index`.\n6. If the calculated position is within the bounds of the string, print the character at that position.\n7. Reset `index` to the position just after the last 'w' to continue scanning from the right.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_string):\n    index = len(input_string) - 1  # Start from the rightmost character\n    count = 0  # Initialize the count of 'w'\n\n    for char in reversed(input_string):  # Iterate from right to left\n        if char == 'w':\n            count += 1\n        elif count > 0:  # Check if 'w' has been encountered\n            position = index - count  # Calculate the position relative to the last 'w'\n            if 0 <= position < len(input_string):  # Ensure the position is valid\n                print(input_string[position])  # Print the character at the calculated position\n                count = 0  # Reset the count for the next 'w'\n                index -= 1  # Move to the position just after the last 'w'\n    return  # Return nothing as we only print the result\n\ninput_string = \"w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i1i0i0i0i1r\"\nfind_digit_after_w(input_string)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the digit after the last 'w' in the provided string. The output will be placed between `<answer>` and </answer>"}
