Initialize a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the current position in the string.\n2. Iterate through the string from the beginning to the end.\n3. Check if the current character is 'w'. If it is, increment the `index`.\n4. Once the loop completes, `index` will hold the position of the rightmost 'w'.\n5.
