Here, I'll use a straightforward iteration:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1, which will keep track of the index of the last 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning.\n3. If the current character is 'w', update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n4. After the iteration, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n5. The digit directly after the rightmost 'w' is the character at `last_w_index + 1`.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i1i0i1i0r1i1i1w0i0r0i0i1i0i1i0i0w1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i0i1w0i1i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1w0i1i1w0i1i0i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i1r0w0i1i1r0i1i1i0w0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r0w0i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1w1i0w1r1w1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r1i1r1w1i0i0i1i0i1i1r1i0i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0w1i0i0i0i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1w1r\"\nlast_w_index = -1\n\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        last_w_index = len(input_string) - 1  # Update the index\n    else:\n        break  # Exit loop once we find the last 'w'\n\n# The digit after the rightmost 'w' is the character at last_w_index + 1\nanswer = \"<answer>B</answer>"}

We'll count the characters from the position immediately after the 15th 'w' until we reach a non-'w' character.\n\nThe 15th 'w' is at position 14 (0-indexed). The next character is at position 15, which is 'i1'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}

Here, I'll use a straightforward iteration:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1 to keep track of the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning.\n3. If the current character is 'w', update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n4. After the iteration, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the last 'w'.\n5. The digit immediately after the last 'w' is the character at `last_w_index + 1`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1w0i0w0r0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i0r0w1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i0i0i0w0r0i0i0i0i0i1i1w0i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0i0i1r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i1i0w1r1i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0r1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1w0i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0i0r0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i1i1i0w0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i1w1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0r1i1i0i0r1i1w0i0i0i0r\"\n\nlast_w_index = -1\nfor char in reversed(input_string):\n    if char == 'w':\n        last_w_index = len(input_string) - 1  # Update the index\n    else:\n        break  # Exit loop when non-'w' character is found\n\n# The digit immediately after the last 'w' is the character at last_w_index + 1\nanswer = '<answer>1</answer>"}
