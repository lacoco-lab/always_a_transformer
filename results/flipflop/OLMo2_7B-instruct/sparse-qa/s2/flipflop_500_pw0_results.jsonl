Look at the character at the position immediately after the last 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\n- The string is composed of various characters, including 'w', digits, and other characters.\n- We need to count the number of 'w' characters until we reach the end of the string.\n\nBy manually inspecting the string, we find that the last 'w' is at position 101.\n\nNow, we need to look at the character directly after position 101. The string is zero-indexed, so position 101 corresponds to the character at index 100 in the string.\n\nThe character at index 100 is '0'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Look at the character directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w'. We'll count the number of 'w' characters and then determine the position of the rightmost one.\n\nThe string contains 15 'w' characters. The rightmost 'w' is the 15th occurrence.\n\nNow, let's look at the character directly to the right of the 15th 'w'. \n\nThe 15th 'w' is in the position 14 (since positions are 1-indexed in programming).\n\nThe character at position 14 in the string is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The sequence before this last 'w' is `w0i0i0r0`.\n\nThus, the position of the last 'w' is 13 (counting the spaces and characters before it).\n\nThe character directly to the right of the last 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

We can do this by iterating through the string and checking each character until we find 'w'. Once we find the last 'w', we look at the character immediately to its right.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i0i1i1i0r1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r1w0i0i0i1w0r0r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1w1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0w1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1w1i0r1r1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1w0r0i0i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0w1i1w1i0r1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1w0r0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i0i0i1w0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0w0r0w0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w'\nlast_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Get the character immediately after the last 'w'\nafter_last_w = input_string[last_w_index + 1]\n\n# Output the result\nanswer = \"<answer>\" + str(after_last_w) + \"</answer>"}
