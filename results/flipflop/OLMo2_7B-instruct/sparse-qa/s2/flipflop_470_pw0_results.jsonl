Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\n- The string is composed of various characters, including digits and letters.\n- The last 'w' appears at the end of the string.\n\nBy examining the string, we can see that the last 'w' is the 81st character from the start of the string.\n\nNow, we need to find the digit directly to the right of this 'w'. Since the string is padded with spaces and does not contain any characters between the 'w' and the end of the string, the digit to the right of the last 'w' is the very first digit of the string after the last 'w', which is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
