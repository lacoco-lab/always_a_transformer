Determine the character at that position.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\nInput string: w0i1i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i0i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i1r0i0r0i0i1r0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0w0i1i0w0i1i1i1r0i1i0i1i1r0i1i1i1r0i1i0w0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r0i1i1i1r0w0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0r0r0r0w1r1i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i1i1r1w0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0w0i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i1w0r0w0i0i0i0i0r\n\nThe last 'w' is at position 101.\n\nNow, let's determine the character at the 101st position in the string. We'll count the characters from the start of the string:\n\n- 'w': 1 occurrence\n- '0': 7 occurrences\n- 'i': 15 occurrences\n- 'r': 10 occurrences\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 7 + 15 + 10 = 33 characters before the first 'w'.\n\nAfter the first 'w': 33 characters + 1 'w' = 34 characters.\n\nThe 101st character is the 101 - 34 = 67th character after the first 'w'.\n\nLet's count the characters from the first 'w' to the 67th character:\n\n- 'w': 1 occurrence\n- '0': 6 occurrences\n- 'i': 9 occurrences\n- 'r': 8 occurrences\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 6 + 9 + 8 = 24 characters.\n\nSo, the 67th character after the first 'w' is the 24th character after the first 'w'.\n\nNow, let's count the characters from the first 'w' to the 24th character:\n\n- 'w': 1 occurrence\n- '0': 6 occurrences\n- 'i': 6 occurrences\n- 'r': 7 occurrences\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 20 characters.\n\nThe 20th character after the first 'w' is 'r'.\n\nTherefore, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Identify the position of the last 'w' in the string.\n2. Determine the character at that position.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\nInput string: w0i1i0w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0i0w0i0i1r0r0i1i0w1i0r1i0i0r1i1r1i1r1i0i1w1r1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i1w1r1i0r1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1w0i0i0i1i0w0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0w0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i1r0i0r0i1i0w0i0i0r\n\nThe last 'w' is at position 81 (0-indexed).\n\nNow, let's determine the character at position 81:\n\nThe string is composed of various characters, including digits (0-9), uppercase letters (A-Z), and lowercase letters (a-z). The pattern seems to involve alternating between characters and numbers, with occasional repetitions.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to consider the repeating patterns in the string. The string appears to have a repeating segment that is 21 characters long:\n\n\"0i1i0w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0i0w0i0i1r0r0i1i0w1i0r1i0i0r1i1r1i1r0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1w1r1i0r1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1w0i0i0i1i0w0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0w0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i1r0i0r0i1i0w0i0i0r\"\n\nThe repeating segment is \"0i1i0w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0i0w0i0i1r0r0i1i0w1i0r1i0i0r1i1r1i1r0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1w1r1i0r1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i1r0i0r0i1i0w0i0i0r\".\n\nThe repeating segment length is 21 characters. To find the character at position 81, we need to consider the position within the repeating block:\n\nPosition 81 modulo 21 = 9\n\nSo, we look at the 9th character in the repeating segment:\n\nThe 9th character in the repeating segment \"0i1i0w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0i0w0i0i1r0r0i1i0w1i0r1i0i0r1i1r1i1r0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1w1r1i0r1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i1r0i0r0i1i0w0i0i0r\" is '0'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
