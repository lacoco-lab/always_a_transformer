The pattern repeats every 4 characters: 'wri1'. \n\nTo find the character at the 113th position:\n- Determine how many complete cycles of 4 characters fit into 113.\n- Calculate the remainder to find the exact position within the cycle.\n\n113 divided by 4 gives us 28 complete cycles with a remainder of 3.\n\nSince the pattern is 'wri1', the 3rd character in each cycle is 'i'. Therefore, the character at the 113th position is 'i'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
