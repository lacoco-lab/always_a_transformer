The pattern seems to be a mix of these characters with varying lengths.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to consider the length of each substring before the final 'w'. Here's a breakdown of the lengths of the substrings before each 'w':\n\n- w1: 2 characters\n- i0: 2 characters\n- i1: 2 characters\n- i0: 2 characters\n- i0: 2 characters\n- r1: 2 characters\n- i0: 2 characters\n- i0: 2 characters\n- i1: 2 characters\n- i0: 2 characters\n- i1: 2 characters\n- i0: 2 characters\n- i1: 2 characters\n- r1: 2 characters\n- i0: 2 characters\n- i1: 2 characters\n- i0: 2 characters\n- i1: 2 characters\n- i0: 2 characters\n- w0: 3 characters\n- i1i1i1i0: 5 characters\n- i1i0i1i0i1: 6 characters\n- i0i1i0i0i1: 5 characters\n- i0i1i0i0i0i0r1: 10 characters\n- r1i0: 2 characters\n- i0: 2 characters\n- i1i1w0: 4 characters\n\nAdding these lengths together gives us a total of 44 characters before the final 'w'. Since the string has 81 characters in total, the character at position 81 is the first character of the substring starting with 'w0'.\n\nThe substring starting with 'w0' is \"w0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i1r0i0r0i0r0w0\".\n\nThe first character of this substring is 'w'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is **0**.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Identify the position of the last 'w' in the string.\n2. Determine the character at that position.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\nInput string: w1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0w0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0w0i1r0r0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0w1i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1r\n\nThe last 'w' is at position 77 (counting from 0).\n\nNow, let's determine the character at position 77:\n\nThe string is composed of various characters, including digits (0-9), uppercase letters (A-Z), and lowercase letters (a-z). The pattern seems to be somewhat random, but we can observe that the characters repeat in a somewhat predictable manner.\n\nTo find the character at position 77, we need to consider the repeating pattern. However, given the complexity of the string, a more straightforward approach is to directly access the character at that position in the string.\n\nLet's use Python to find the character at position 77:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0w0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0w0i1r0r0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0w1i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1r\"\n\ncharacter_at_77 = input_string[76]  # Python uses 0-based indexing\n\n# Output the result\nif character_at_77 == '0':\n    answer = 'A'\nelse:\n    answer = 'B'\n\nprint(answer)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the character at position 77. Based on the string provided, the character at position 77 is '0'. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
