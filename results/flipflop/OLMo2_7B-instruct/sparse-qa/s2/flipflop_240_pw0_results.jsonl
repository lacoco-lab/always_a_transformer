The string is structured with alternating sequences of '0', 'i', 'w', and 'r'. \n\nGiven the length of the string (which is 101 characters), we can determine the position of each character by counting the total characters and identifying the specific position within the pattern.\n\nThe sequence \"0i0w0ir\" repeats every 6 characters:\n- '0' -> 1 time\n- 'i' -> 2 times\n- '0' -> 1 time\n- 'w' -> 1 time\n- 'r' -> 1 time\n\nThus, every 6 characters, we have one 'w'.\n\nTo find the 81st character:\n- Calculate the remainder when 81 is divided by 6: \\( 81 \\mod 6 = 3 \\)\n- The remainder tells us the position within the repeating sequence \"0i0w0ir\".\n\nThe sequence at the 3rd position within the repeating block \"0i0w0ir\" is:\n- '0'\n- 'i'\n- '0'\n- 'w'\n\nSo, the character at the 81st position is 'w'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
