The string length is 101 characters. The characters before the rightmost 'w' are:\n\n- w1 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- r1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- r1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- r0 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- r (1 character)\n\nThis totals 20 characters before the rightmost 'w'. Therefore, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is the 78th character in the string.\n\nNow, let's count the characters in the string to find the 78th character:\n\n- w1: 1 character\n- i1: 2 characters\n- r1: 1 character\n- i0: 2 characters\n- i0: 2 characters\n- i1: 1 character\n- r1: 1 character\n- i0: 1 character\n- r0: 1 character\n- i0: 1 character\n- i1: 1 character\n- i0: 1 character\n- i1: 1 character\n- i0: 1 character\n- i1: 1 character\n- i0: 1 character\n- i1: 1 character\n- i0: 1 character\n- r: 1 character\n\nSumming these gives us 20 characters before the rightmost 'w'. The 78th character is the first character of the next group: \"i0\".\n\nThus, the character at position 78 is 'i0'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}

The string length is 101 characters. The characters before the rightmost 'w' are:\n\n- 'i' (0 times)\n- '0' (5 times)\n- 'i' (5 times)\n- '0' (5 times)\n- 'r' (1 time)\n\nThis totals to 16 characters before the 'w'. Therefore, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is the 77th character in the string.\n\nLet's count the characters in the string to find the 77th character:\n\n- 'w': 1 time\n- '1': 5 times\n- 'i': 10 times\n- '0': 10 times\n- 'r': 1 time\n\nSumming these up gives us 22 characters. Since the string is 101 characters long, the characters from the 23rd to the 77th position are:\n\n- 'i': 5 times\n- '0': 5 times\n- 'r': 1 time\n\nThus, the 77th character is the second '0' from the start of this sequence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Determine the character at that position.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\nInput string: w1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i1r1i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1r0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i1i1i0i0r0w0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1r0w0i1w0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i1w1i1i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i0i0i0r1i0w1\n\nThe last 'w' is at position 81 (0-indexed).\n\nNow, let's determine the character at position 81:\n\nThe string is composed of various characters, including digits (0-9), lowercase letters (a-z), and uppercase letters (A-Z). The pattern of characters suggests that the string is structured in a way that digits and letters alternate, with occasional 'r' characters interspersed.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to consider the structure of the string. Given the alternating pattern and the presence of 'r' characters, it's likely that the character at position 81 is a digit.\n\nLet's verify this by examining the sequence leading up to position 81:\n\n- The sequence before position 81 includes: 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'w', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'r', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'r', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'r', '0' (up to 'i').\n\nThe characters in this sequence are all 'i', '0', 'r', or 'w'. The digit '1' appears at positions 76, 77, and 78, and the letter 'w' appears at position 80.\n\nGiven the alternating pattern and the fact that 'r' and 'w' do not appear consecutively at position 81, the most likely character at position 81 is a digit.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is **B** (1).\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Determine the character immediately after this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput string: w1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i0i0w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0w1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0r1r1w1i0i1i1i1i0i0r1r1w1i0i1i1i0i0w1i1r1i0i0w0i1r0i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at position 77 (0-indexed).\n\nTo find the character immediately after this 'w', we need to consider the length of the string and the positions of the characters before it. The string has 101 characters in total.\n\nSince the rightmost 'w' is at position 77, the next character will be at position 78. However, we need to ensure that this position is valid within the string.\n\nLet's check the length of the string segments before position 78:\n\n- The segment before 'w0' has 10 characters ('w1', 'i1', 'i0', 'i0', 'i1', 'i0', 'i0', 'i0', 'i1', 'i0').\n- The segment before 'i0w0' has 9 characters ('w0').\n\nThus, the segment before the rightmost 'w' has 10 characters, and the next character after position 77 will be in the segment starting at position 68 (since 77 - 10 + 1 = 68).\n\nNow, let's look at the character at position 68:\n\nInput string at position 68: 'i0'\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
