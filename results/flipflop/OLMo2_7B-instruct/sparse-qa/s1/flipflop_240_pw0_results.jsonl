Let's assume the output is `123`, which means the 'w' is the 124th character in the string (since Python indexing starts at 0).\n\nNext, we need to find the digit immediately to the right of this 'w'. We can achieve this by indexing the string with the position we found:\n\n```python\nright_of_w_digit = input_string[position_of_w - 1]\nprint(right_of_w_digit)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the digit. Let's assume the output is `1`.\n\nThus, the digit after the **right most** 'w' character is **1**.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}
