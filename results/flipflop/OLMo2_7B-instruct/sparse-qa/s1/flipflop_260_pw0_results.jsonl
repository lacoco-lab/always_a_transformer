The characters before the rightmost 'w' are:\n\n- w1 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- r1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- r1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- r1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- w1 (1 character)\n- r1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- w1 (1 character)\n- r1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- w0 (1 character)\n\nCounting these characters gives us a total of 22 characters before the rightmost 'w'. Therefore, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is the 23rd character in the string.\n\nThe 23rd character is 'i0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
