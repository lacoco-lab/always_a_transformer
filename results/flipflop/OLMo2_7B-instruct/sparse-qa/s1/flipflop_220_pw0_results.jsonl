However, given the structure of the string and the fact that it seems to be a mix of alphanumeric characters, we can infer that the next character will be determined by the immediate context.\n\nGiven the complexity of the string and the need for an algorithmic approach, let's simplify by examining the pattern around the 'w'. The string appears to be structured in a way that might repeat certain sequences. However, without a clear repeating pattern that directly influences the character after 'w', we can rely on the positional analysis.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' (at position 65) is 'i'. This is based on the direct sequence without considering any complex pattern due to the string's length and the mix of characters.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
