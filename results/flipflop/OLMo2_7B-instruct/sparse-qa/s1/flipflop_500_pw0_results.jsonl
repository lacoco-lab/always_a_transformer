Determine the character at the position immediately after the last 'w'.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of 'w' in the string:\n\n```\nw: 16 occurrences\ni: 11 occurrences\nr: 11 occurrences\n```\n\nThe last 'w' is the 16th occurrence of 'w'. To find the character immediately after it, we need to consider the string's length (which is 63 characters) and the positions:\n\n- The 16th 'w' is at position 15 (since positions are 0-indexed).\n- The character at position 15 is 'i'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is 'i', which corresponds to option B.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
