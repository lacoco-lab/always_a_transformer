Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning.\n3. If the current character is 'w', update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n4.

Determine the character at the position immediately after the last 'w'.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the position of the last 'w'**\n\nThe string ends with the word \"w0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i0w0i0i1r0i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i0r0i1i1i0i1r1i1w1w1i1i0w1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1w1i1w1i1i1i0i0r\".\n\nThe last 'w' is the 76th character in the string.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the character at the 77th position**\n\nTo find the character at the 77th position, we need to consider the string's length (76 characters) and the fact that strings in programming are zero-indexed. Therefore, the 77th position is actually the first character of the 77th \"block\" of characters.\n\nThe first character of the 77th block is '0'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n<answer>0</answer>"}
