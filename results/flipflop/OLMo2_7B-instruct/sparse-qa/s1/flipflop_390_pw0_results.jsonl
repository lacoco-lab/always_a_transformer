We need to identify the pattern and the character at the 81st position.\n\nUpon examining the string, we notice that the characters repeat in a specific pattern. The repeating unit is \"w0i0i0i1i1i1\". This repeating unit has a length of 7 characters.\n\nTo find the character at position 81:\n- Determine how many complete repeating units fit into 81 characters.\n- Calculate the remainder to find the exact position within the repeating unit.\n\n81 divided by 7 gives us 11 complete repeating units with a remainder of 4.\n\nThe 4th character in the repeating unit \"w0i0i0i1i1i1\" is 'i0'.\n\nThus, the character at position 81 is 'i0'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>0</answer>"}
