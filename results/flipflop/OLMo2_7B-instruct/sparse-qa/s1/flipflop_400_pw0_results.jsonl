To do this, we'll consider the string as a continuous sequence of characters and extract the substring starting from the 76th character up to the end of the string.\n\nLet's extract and analyze this substring:\n\nSubstring: 1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0w0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r0i1i1i0w1i1i1i0r1r1w0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0w0i0r0r0i1i1i0w0r0i0i0r0i0i0i1r0w0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1w1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r\n\nThe substring ends at position 102 (including the trailing 'r'). The characters in this substring are: 'i', '1', 'i', '0', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'r', '0', 'r', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'r', '0', 'w', '0', 'r', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'w', '0'.\n\nThe first digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nThus, the answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}
