The pattern seems to be somewhat irregular, but we can observe that the characters repeat in a somewhat predictable manner.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to understand the repeating pattern. Let's analyze the first few characters to identify any repeating sequences:\n\n- The first 'w' is at position 81.\n- The sequence \"i1i0\" repeats.\n- The sequence \"r1i1i1\" also repeats.\n\nGiven the complexity of the repeating pattern, a direct algorithmic approach to find the character at position 81 without manually inspecting the pattern might involve:\n\n1. Constructing a lookup table where each index corresponds to a character.\n2. Using this table to retrieve the character at position 81.\n\nHowever, due to the irregularity and length of the string, a more practical approach is to manually inspect the repeating sequences and extrapolate the pattern to find the character at position 81.\n\nUpon manual inspection, it appears that the repeating sequences do not align neatly enough to directly calculate the character without a more detailed analysis or a computational tool to identify the exact character at position 81.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precision, a computational approach would be ideal. However, based on manual inspection and the nature of the repeating sequences, it seems likely that the character at position 81 is a digit.\n\nConsidering the options provided:\nA. 0\nB. 1\n\nGiven the context and the nature of the repeating sequences, the most plausible answer is **A. 0**.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

The pattern seems to be a mix of random characters, but we can observe that the string is structured in a way that it alternates between different character types.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to consider the length of each segment of characters before 'w'. The string is divided into segments like \"w1r1i0r1r1i0\", where each segment ends with a digit.\n\nLet's count the characters in each segment:\n- \"w1r1i0\" has 5 characters.\n- \"r1r1i0r1\" has 5 characters.\n- \"i0i0i1i0\" has 5 characters.\n- \"i0i0i1i1i0\" has 6 characters.\n- \"i0i0i1i0w\" has 6 characters.\n- \"0i1i0i1i0\" has 6 characters.\n- \"i1i0i1i1r\" has 6 characters.\n- \"0i0i0i0i1i\" has 6 characters.\n- \"r0i0i1i0i0\" has 6 characters.\n- \"w0r0i0w1\" has 7 characters.\n- \"1i1w1i1w1i0\" has 8 characters.\n\nThe pattern suggests that each segment ends with a digit, and the length of the segments increases by 1 with each subsequent segment.\n\nGiven this pattern, the 81st character falls within the segment \"1i1w1i1w1i0\", which has 8 characters. Therefore, the 81st character is the 8th digit in this segment, which is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The pattern seems to be somewhat random, but we can observe that the characters repeat in a somewhat consistent manner.\n\nTo find the character at position 77, we can use a simple loop or indexing in a programming language. However, since we are solving this algorithmically, let's simulate the process:\n\n- The string starts with 'w', followed by a mix of characters.\n- The repeating pattern seems to be \"w0i0i1\" followed by \"r1r1r1\".\n\nLet's count the characters in the repeating pattern \"w0i0i1r1r1r1\":\n- w: 1\n- 0: 1\n- i: 3\n- 0: 1\n- i: 3\n- 1: 1\n- r: 4\n\nTotal characters in one cycle = 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 11 characters\n\nNow, we need to find the position within the repeating cycle:\n- Position 77 modulo 11 = 77 % 11 = 6\n\nThis means position 77 falls within the 6th cycle of the repeating pattern \"w0i0i1r1r1r1\".\n\nLet's determine the character at position 6 in the repeating pattern:\n- w: 1st occurrence (positions 1-11)\n- 0: 2nd occurrence (positions 12-22)\n- i: 3rd occurrence (positions 23-33)\n- 0: 4th occurrence (positions 34-44)\n- i: 5th occurrence (positions 45-55)\n- 1: 6th occurrence (positions 56-66)\n\nPosition 6 in the repeating cycle \"w0i0i1r1r1r1\" corresponds to the character '0'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

The pattern seems to be a mix of numbers and letters, but there is no clear repeating pattern that would simplify finding the character at a specific index.\n\nTo accurately find the character at position 77, we need to consider the entire string and its composition. Given the complexity of the string and the absence of a clear repeating pattern, a direct algorithmic approach without additional context or constraints might not be straightforward.\n\nHowever, based on the structure of the string and the characters present, we can infer that the character at position 77 is likely to be a digit due to the prevalence of digits in the string. Given the options provided (A. 0 or B. 1), and without a clear repeating pattern to rely on, we can make an educated guess based on the distribution of digits observed in the string.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for an educated guess, the most reasonable assumption based on the observed pattern is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Each segment ends at an 'i' and the next segment starts immediately after the 'i'. \n\nGiven the complexity of the string and the need to account for the varying lengths of these segments, a direct index calculation might not suffice.
