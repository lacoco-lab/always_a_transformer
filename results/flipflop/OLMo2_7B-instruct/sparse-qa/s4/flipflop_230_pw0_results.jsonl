The string length is 101 characters. The characters before the rightmost 'w' are:\n\n- w1 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- r1 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- r1 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- r0 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- r0 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- w0 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- r0 (1 character)\n- i0 (1 character)\n- r1 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- i1 (1 character)\n- w0 (1 character)\n\nThis sums up to 19 characters before the rightmost 'w'.

Adding the 'w' gives us 16 non-'w' characters. The 76th character is the 76 - 16 + 1 = 61st character in the sequence of all characters (including spaces and 'r').\n\nNow, let's count the characters in the string including spaces and 'r':\n\n- ' ': 11 occurrences\n- 'r': 4 occurrences\n\nThis sums up to 15 characters that are not 'w' or spaces.
