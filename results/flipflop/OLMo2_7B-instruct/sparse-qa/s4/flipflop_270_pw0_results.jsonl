The pattern seems to involve alternating between different sequences of characters.\n\nTo accurately determine the character at position 81, we need to consider the repeating patterns in the string. The string appears to have a repeating structure, but due to its length, we need to carefully analyze it.\n\nGiven the complexity of the string and the need for an algorithmic approach, let's use a Python script to find the character at position 81:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i1i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0w0i0w0r0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1w1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0r1i1i1i1i0w1i0i1w1i0i0i1r1w0i1i0i1i1r0i0w1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0r1i1i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w1r1w1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0w1i0i1i0i1i0i0r\"\n\n# Find the character at position 81 (0-indexed)\ncharacter_at_position_81 = input_string[80]  # Adjust for 0-indexing\n\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(character_at_position_81) + \"</answer>"}

The string length is 101 characters.\n\nSince the 'w' is at position 77, the next character is at position 78. However, we must ensure that this position is valid and contains a character. Given the structure of the string, it alternates between digits and characters, and the last 'w' is followed by a '0'.\n\nThus, the character at position 78 is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
