The pattern seems to be a mix of numbers and letters, but there is no clear repeating pattern that simplifies finding the character at a specific index directly.\n\nTo accurately find the character at position 81, we would typically use a programming approach to iterate through the string and access the character at the specified index. However, given the complexity and length of the string, a manual approach here might involve counting the characters until reaching the 81st position.\n\nLet's count the characters manually:\n\n- The string starts with 'w', followed by '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', '0', 'i', '0', 'w', and so on.\n- The pattern \"wi\" repeats several times, followed by varying characters.\n\nAfter manually counting, we find that the 81st character is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
