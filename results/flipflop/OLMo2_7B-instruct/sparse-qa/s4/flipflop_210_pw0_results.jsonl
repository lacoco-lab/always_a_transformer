The string length is 101 characters.\n\nSince the 77th character is 'w', the 78th character will be the next one. We need to determine this character by looking at the pattern of the string.\n\nThe string alternates between characters and numbers, and the pattern seems to repeat in blocks. Let's identify the pattern:\n\n- The first block: w0w0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0r0i1i0i0\n- The second block: 0w0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0r0i1i0i0\n- The third block: i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0r0i1i0i0\n- The fourth block: 0i0i1i1i0i0i1r0r0i1i0i0\n- And so on...\n\nEach block consists of 10 characters, starting with 'w', followed by a sequence of characters (0, i0, i1), and ending with a number (0, 0, 1).\n\nGiven that the 77th position is within the third block (since the first block is 0-9 characters, the second is 10-19, and the third is 20-29), we need to find the character at the 78th position in this block.\n\nThe third block is: i0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1i0i0\n\nThe 78th position falls within the sequence \"i0i1i0i0i1\". The 78th character is the first character of this sequence, which is 'i'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The characters before the last 'w' are:\n- 1 'w' (at position 1)\n- 0 characters before the first 'w'\n- 10 'i' characters before the first 'r' following the first 'w'\n- 1 'r' before the first 'i' following the first 'w'\n- 10 'i' characters before the first 'r' following the second 'w'\n- 1 'r' before the first 'i' following the second 'w'\n- 11 'i' characters before the first 'r' following the third 'w'\n- 1 'r' before the first 'i' following the third 'w'\n- 10 'i' characters before the first 'r' following the fourth 'w'\n- 1 'w' at the end\n\nSumming these up:\n- 1 ('w') + 0 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 11 + 1 + 10 = 64 characters\n\nThus, the 102nd character is the 38th character in the sequence of characters excluding 'w'. Counting from the start of the string:\n- The first 'w' is at position 1\n- The 38th character is at position 1 + (38 - 1) = 38\n\nNow, let's count the characters from the start of the string until the 38th position:\n- Characters before the first 'w': 0\n- Characters before the first 'r' after the first 'w': 10\n- Characters before the first 'i' after the first 'r': 1\n- Characters before the first 'r' after the second 'w': 10\n- Characters before the first 'i' after the second 'r': 1\n- Characters before the first 'r' after the third 'w': 11\n- Characters before the first 'i' after the third 'w': 1\n- Characters before the fourth 'w': 10\n\nSumming these up:\n- 0 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 11 + 1 + 10 = 44\n\nSo, the 38th character is the 44th character in the sequence of characters excluding 'w'. Counting from the start of the string:\n- The first 'i' after the first 'r' following the second 'w' is at position 10 + 1 = 11\n- The next 'i' is at position 11 + 1 = 12\n- The next 'r' is at position 12 + 1 = 13\n- The next 'i' is at position 13 + 1 = 14\n- The next 'r' is at position 14 + 1 = 15\n- The next 'i' is at position 15 + 1 = 16\n- The next 'r' is at position 16 + 1 = 17\n- The next 'i' is at position 17 + 1 = 18\n- The next 'r' is at position 18 + 1 = 19\n- The next 'i' is at position 19 + 1 = 20\n- The next 'r' is at position 20 + 1 = 21\n- The next 'i' is at position 21 + 1 = 22\n- The next 'r' is at position 22 + 1 = 23\n- The next 'i' is at position 23 + 1 = 24\n- The next 'r' is at position 24 + 1 = 25\n- The next 'i' is at position 25 + 1 = 26\n- The next 'r' is at position 26 + 1 = 27\n- The next 'i' is at position 27 + 1 = 28\n- The next 'r' is at position 28 + 1 = 29\n- The next 'i' is at position 29 + 1 = 30\n- The next 'r' is at position 30 + 1 = 31\n- The next 'i' is at position 31 + 1 = 32\n- The next 'r' is at position 32 + 1 = 33\n- The next 'i' is at position 33 + 1 = 34\n- The next 'r' is at position 34 + 1 = 35\n- The next 'i' is at position 35 + 1 = 36\n- The next 'r' is at position 36 + 1 = 37\n- The next 'i' is at position 37 + 1 = 38\n\nThe 38th character is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The string is composed of a mix of digits and characters, with a pattern that repeats in blocks.\n\nGiven the complexity of the string and the need for an algorithmic approach, let's break down the string into manageable parts:\n\n1. **Identify the repeating block:** The repeating block appears to be \"w0i1i1i1i1i1r0\". This block repeats several times.\n2. **Determine the position within the block:** Since the block repeats, we need to find the position of the 'w' within one block and then determine the position within the entire string.\n\nThe block \"w0i1i1i1i1i1r0\" has a length of 7 characters. The 'w' is the 3rd character in this block.\n\nGiven that the entire string length is 101 characters and considering the repeating pattern, we can calculate the position within the repeating cycle:\n\n- **Total repetitions of the block:** \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{101}{7} \\right\\rfloor = 14 \\) full blocks, with a remainder of 1.\n- **Position within the block:** Since the block repeats every 7 characters, the 3rd character in the block will be at position \\( 3 \\mod 7 = 3 \\).\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is the character at position 3 within the block \"w0i1i1i1i1i1r0\".\n\nLet's extract the character at position 3 in the block:\n\n```\nw0i1i1i1i1i1r0\n```\n\nThe character at position 3 is 'i1'. Since we are asked for the digit, we interpret 'i1' as the digit '1'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
