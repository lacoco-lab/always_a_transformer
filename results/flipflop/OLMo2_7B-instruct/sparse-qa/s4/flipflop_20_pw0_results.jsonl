Find the position of the rightmost 'w':\n   - The string ends with 'r', so we start from the end and move backwards.\n   - The last 'w' is at position 11 (0-indexed).\n\n3. Determine the character at position 12 (since positions are 0-indexed):\n   - The character at position 12 is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
