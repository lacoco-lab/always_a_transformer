The string has 77 characters in total.\n\nSince the rightmost 'w' is at position 37, the next character will be at position 38. However, we need to ensure that this position is valid within the string.\n\nLet's count the characters up to position 38:\n- Characters before position 38: w, 1, i, 1, i, 0, i, 1, i, 1, i, 1, i, 0, r, 1, i, 1, i, 0, i, 0, r, 1, i, 1, i, 1, i, 0, i, 0, r, 1, i, 0, i, 1, i, 0, i, 0, r, 1, i, 0, i, 1, i, 0, i, 0, r, 0, w, 1, r, 1, i, 1, i, 1, i, 0, i, 0, i, 0, r, 1, i, 0, i, 1, i, 0, i, 0, r, 0, w, 1, r, 1, i, 1, i, 1, i, 0, i, 0, i, 0, r, 1, i, 0, i, 1, i, 0, i, 0, r, 0\n\nThere are 37 'w', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', and other characters before the last 'w'. The 38th position falls after the last character in the string.\n\nTherefore, the character at position 38 is the first character of the string, which is 'w'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The string length is 101 characters.\n\nSince the 'w' is at position 77, the next character is at position 78. However, we need to ensure that this position is valid within the string. Given the structure of the string, it appears to be a mix of digits and characters, but the pattern is not immediately clear without further analysis.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n- The string seems to have a repeating pattern of digits and characters.\n- The repeating segment length is not immediately obvious, but we can infer it by looking at the sequence.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the repeating segment length is 10 characters long (considering the repeating nature of 'i0' sequences and other characters).\n\nGiven this, the character at position 78 (which is 1 beyond the rightmost 'w') falls within the repeating segment starting at index 68 (since 78 - 10 = 68).\n\nLet's determine the character at index 68 in the repeating segment:\n- The repeating segment is \"w1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1\"\n\nIndex 68 in this segment corresponds to the character 'i0'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>0</answer>"}

Determine the character at that position.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\nInput string: w0r0i0i1i0w1r1i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0w0i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i0r0i1r0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0w0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i1i1i0w0r0i1w1i0i1i1i0r1i0i0r1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1w0i1i0w0i1i1i1i0i1r\n\nThe last 'w' is at position 81 (0-indexed).\n\nNow, let's determine the character at position 81:\n\nThe string is composed of various characters, including digits (0-9), lowercase letters (a-z), and uppercase letters (A-Z). We need to identify the pattern or sequence of characters to find the specific character at position 81.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the string appears to be a mix of alphanumeric characters with a repeating pattern. The repeating pattern seems to be \"wrioi0iw\" followed by \"r1i0i0i1\".\n\nLet's verify this pattern by extracting a few repetitions:\n- \"wrioi0iw\" starts at position 0 and ends at position 7.\n- \"r1i0i0i1\" starts at position 7 and ends at position 11.\n\nThe next complete cycle of \"wrioi0iw\" would start at position 11 and end at position 18, but since we are only interested in the rightmost 'w', we need to check the next occurrence of 'w' after position 81.\n\nGiven the repeating nature and the length of each cycle, we can calculate the position of the next 'w' after 81:\n- Each \"wrioi0iw\" cycle is 7 characters long.\n- Each \"r1i0i0i1\" cycle is 4 characters long.\n\nThe total length of one complete cycle (7 + 4) = 11 characters.\n\nTo find the next 'w' after position 81:\n\\[ \\text{Next 'w' position} = 81 + (11 - \\text{position of last 'w'}) \\]\n\nSince the last 'w' is at position 81, the next 'w' will be at:\n\\[ 81 + (11 - 81) = 81 + (-70) = 11 \\]\n\nAt position 11, the character is 'w'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

To find the character at position 81, we need to consider the length of each segment of characters and their respective counts.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the string's structure:\n- 'w' characters: 3\n- '1' characters: 8\n- 'i' characters: 10\n- Other characters: 0 (for simplicity, as they don't contribute to the count)\n\nThe total length of the string is the sum of all these characters' counts plus the spaces between them. However, since we're only interested in the character at position 81, we need to consider the cumulative length of the segments until we reach or exceed position 81.\n\nLet's calculate the cumulative length:\n\n- The first 'w' is followed by '1', making 2 characters.\n- The next 'w' adds 3 more characters.\n- The next '1' adds 8 characters.\n- The next 'i' adds 10 characters.\n- The next 'i' adds

To find the character at position 81, we need to consider the length of each segment of characters and their respective counts.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the string's structure:\n- 'w' characters: 3\n- '1' characters: 8\n- 'i' characters: 10\n- Other characters: 0 (for simplicity, as they don't contribute to the count)\n\nThe total length of the string is the sum of all these characters' counts plus the spaces between them. However, since we're only interested in the character at position 81, we need to consider the cumulative length of the segments until we reach or exceed position 81.\n\nLet's calculate the cumulative length:\n\n- The first 'w' is followed by '1', making 2 characters.\n- The next 'w' adds 3 more characters.\n- The next '1' adds 8 characters.\n- The next 'i' adds 10 characters.\n- The next 'i' adds

The pattern seems to be a mix of alphanumeric characters with occasional spaces and uppercase letters.\n\nTo accurately determine the character at position 81, we need to consider the length of each segment of characters. However, due to the complexity of the string and the mixed character types, a direct algorithmic approach without parsing the string character by character would be more efficient.\n\nGiven the string's structure, it appears to be a long sequence with varying lengths of alphanumeric characters. The final 'w' is part of a segment that ends at position 81. The segment before it seems to be composed of digits and lowercase letters.\n\nLet's assume the segment before the last 'w' is entirely composed of digits and lowercase letters. The longest continuous sequence of such characters before 'w' would be from the beginning of the string up to the first 'w', which is at position 1.\n\nSince the string is very long and the segments are not uniform, we can infer that the character at position 81 is likely to be a digit based on the pattern observed.\n\nThus, the character at position 81 is most probably a '0'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The string is composed of several groups of characters separated by 'r' characters. Each group seems to follow a pattern of 'w', followed by a sequence of 'i' and sometimes 'r'.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n- The first group after 'w1w1i1i1r1w0' is 'i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0'.\n- The second group after 'w0i1i1i0r0r0i0i1i1i0' is 'w1i0i0r1i0r1i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1'.\n\nThe second group ends at position 22, and the next character starts at position 23. The character at position 23 is 'w0'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is **0**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The pattern seems to be a mix of numbers and letters, but there is no clear repeating pattern that would simplify finding the character at a specific index.\n\nTo accurately find the character, we need to consider the entire string and its composition. Given the complexity of the string and the absence of a clear repeating pattern, a direct algorithmic approach without additional context or constraints might not be straightforward.\n\nHowever, based on the structure of the string and the characters preceding the last 'w', we can infer that the character at position 81 is likely a digit. Given the context and the nature of the string, the most reasonable assumption is that the digit is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
