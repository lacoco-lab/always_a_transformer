However, we are interested in the **immediately** following character, which is the first character of the next cycle.\n\nThe next cycle begins with \"i\" (since 'i' appears every 3 characters and the last 'i' before 76 is at position 63).\n\nThus, the character at position 77 is 'i'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
