Determine the character at the position immediately after the last 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\n- The string is composed of several groups of characters, each group separated by '0'.\n- Each group contains a mix of '0', 'i', 'r', and 'w' characters.\n- The last 'w' is the last character in the entire string.\n\nThe entire string has 102 characters. The groups are separated by '0', and the last 'w' is the 101st character (since counting starts from 0).\n\nTo find the character immediately after the last 'w', we look at the 102nd position in the string.\n\nThe 102nd character is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

We'll count the occurrences of 'w' from the start of the string until we reach the end.\n\n```plaintext\nw1  i1  r1  i1  i0  r1  i0  i0  r1  i0  i0  r1  i0  i0  r1  i1  i0  i0  i0  i1  i1  i0  i0  i0  i1  i1  i0  w0  r0  i0  i0  i1  w0  i1  i0  i0  i0  i1  i0  i0  i1  i1  i0  i0  i1  i0  r\n```\n\nCounting the 'w' characters, we find there are 15 occurrences of 'w'.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is the 15th occurrence.\n\nNow, we need to find the character immediately to the right of the 15th 'w'. We look at the 16th position in the string (since positions are 1-indexed).\n\nThe 16th character in the string is 'r'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
