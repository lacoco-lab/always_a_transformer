Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1 to keep track of the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning (to find the rightmost 'w').\n3. For each character, check if it is 'w'.\n4. If it is 'w', update `last_w_index` to the current index.\n5. After the loop, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the rightmost 'w'.\n6. Get the character at `last_w_index + 1` (since indices are 0-based in most programming languages).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i1w1i0i0i1i0r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0r1i0w1i0i0i1i0i0w1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i0i1r1i0i1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i0r1i1i0i0r1r1i0i1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i0w1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i1i1w0i0w0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1i1i0w0i0i1w0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1r0r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i1i1r0r\"\n\n# Find the rightmost 'w'\nlast_w_index = -1\nfor i in range(len(input_string) - 1, -1, -1):\n    if input_string[i] == 'w':\n        last_w_index = i\n        break\n\n# Get the character immediately after the rightmost 'w'\nanswer_char = input_string[last_w_index + 1]\n\n# Output the answer\nanswer = <answer> B </answer>"}
