Determine the digit directly to the right of that 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\n- The string is quite long, and it contains multiple 'w' characters interspersed with other characters.\n- We will count the number of 'w' characters until we reach the last one.\n\nBy manually inspecting the string, we find that the last 'w' appears at the 113th position in the string.\n\nNow, we need to determine the digit directly to the right of this 'w'. We will count the characters from the 113th position onward until we find a digit.\n\nThe characters from the 113th to the 122nd positions are:\n```\n0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0r0i1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i0w1i1r1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i0w1i1r1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r0r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0w0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1r0w0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0w0\n```\n\nAt the 122nd position, we find the digit '0'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n<answer>0</answer>"}
