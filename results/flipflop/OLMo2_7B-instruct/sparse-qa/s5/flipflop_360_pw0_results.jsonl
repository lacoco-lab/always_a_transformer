Identify the position of the last 'w' in the string.\n2. Determine the character at that position.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\nInput string: w1i0i1i0r1i1r1i0i1r1i0w1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i0r1i1i0i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1w0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0w1i0i1i0i0r1r1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0w0i1i1i0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i0w1r1i0i0i1i1i0r1i0i1i0w0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i1r\n\nThe last 'w' is at position 81 (0-indexed).\n\nNow, let's determine the character at position 81:\n\nThe string is composed of various characters, including digits (0-9), lowercase letters (a-z), and uppercase letters (A-Z). The pattern seems to involve alternating between different sequences of characters.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to consider the repeating patterns in the string. The string appears to have a repeating structure, but due to its length, we need to carefully analyze it.\n\nLet's break down the string into chunks to identify any repeating sequences:\n\n- The first chunk: w1i0i1i0r1i1r1i0i1r1i0\n- The second chunk: w1i0i1i0r1i1r1i0i1r1i0 (repeats the first chunk)\n- The third chunk: i0i1i0r1i1r1i0i1r1i0 (repeats the second chunk)\n- The fourth chunk: i0i1i0r1i1r1i0i1r1i0 (repeats the second chunk)\n\nEach chunk is 11 characters long. The entire string is 81 characters long, which means it contains 7 full chunks plus a partial chunk.\n\nGiven that the string is structured with alternating sequences and considering the length, the character at position 81 is likely to be a digit (0-9) due to the pattern observed.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the digit at position 81 is **0**.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

The pattern seems to be a mix of numbers and letters, but there is no clear repeating pattern that would simplify finding the character at a specific index.\n\nTo accurately find the character at position 81, we would typically use a programming approach to iterate through the string and access the character at the specified index. However, given the complexity and length of the string, a manual approach here might involve counting the characters until reaching the 81st position.\n\nLet's count the characters manually:\n\n- The string starts with 'w', followed by '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'w', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'w', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i</answer>"}

We'll count the characters from the start of the string:\n\n- 'w': 1 occurrence\n- '1': 4 occurrences\n- 'i': 13 occurrences\n- '0': 6 occurrences\n- 'r': 7 occurrences\n\nSumming these counts gives us 1 + 4 + 13 + 6 + 7 = 31 characters before the first 'w'. Adding the 'w' itself makes it 32 characters before the next 'w'.\n\nThe 101st character is the 70th character after the first 'w'. Now, let's count the characters from the first 'w' to the 70th character:\n\n- 'w': 1 occurrence\n- '1': 3 occurrences\n- 'i': 10 occurrences\n- '0': 5 occurrences\n- 'r': 6 occurrences\n\nSumming these counts gives us 1 + 3 + 10 + 5 + 6 = 25 characters before the second 'w'.\n\nTherefore, the 70th character after the first 'w' is the 25th character after the second 'w'. Let's count the characters from the second 'w' to the 25th character:\n\n- 'w': 1 occurrence\n- '0': 2 occurrences\n- 'r': 5 occurrences\n\nSumming these counts gives us 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 characters before the 25th character after the second 'w'.\n\nThe 25th character after the second 'w' is the 17th character in this sequence ('w0r'). Counting from the start of this sequence:\n\n- 'w': 1 occurrence\n- '0': 2 occurrences\n- 'r': 5 occurrences\n\nSumming these counts gives us 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 characters.\n\nThe 17th character in this sequence is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

We need to identify the pattern or sequence of characters to find the exact character at position 81.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we notice that the string alternates between sequences of digits and letters, with a specific repeating pattern:\n\n- Sequence: w followed by a series of digits, then a space, and another series of digits.\n- Example: w1r1i0i0i1i0r1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1w0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i1i0i1r\n\nEach full cycle (including the 'w', digits, space, and digits) is 11 characters long. To find the character at position 81:\n\n- Calculate the remainder when 81 is divided by the length of one cycle (11): \\(81 \\mod 11 = 10\\).\n\nThis means the character at position 81 corresponds to the 10th character in the cycle.\n\nThe 10th character in the repeating sequence \"w1r1i0i0i1i0r1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1w0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i1i0i1r\" is 'i0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
