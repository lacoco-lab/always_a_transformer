Python's `index()` method can help us find the position of the last occurrence of a character:\n\n```python\nlast_w_position = input_string.rindex('w')\n```\n\nThe position `last_w_position` tells us where the last 'w' is located in the string.\n\nFinally, we need to determine the character immediately to the right of the last 'w'. We can get this by indexing the string with `last_w_position + 1`:\n\n```python\nright_after_w = input_string[last_w_position + 1]\n```\n\nLet's put it all together in Python code to get the final answer:\n\n```python\n# Count the number of 'w' characters\nnum_w = input_string.count('w')\n\n# Find the position of the last 'w'\nlast_w_position = input_string.rindex('w')\n\n# Get the character immediately to the right of the last 'w'\nright_after_w = input_string[last_w_position + 1]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(right_after_w) + \"</answer>"}
