The string is composed of several groups of characters separated by 'r' characters. Each group seems to follow a pattern of alternating '0', 'i', '1', and spaces.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n- The first group: `w0i0i1i1i1r0`\n- The second group: `0i0i1i1i0r0`\n- The third group: `i0i1i0i1i0r0`\n- And so on...\n\nEach group starts with 'w', followed by a sequence of '0', 'i', '1', and spaces. The length of this sequence seems to vary but follows a consistent pattern.\n\nTo find the character after the rightmost 'w', we need to determine the length of the sequence before the rightmost 'w' and then find the character at the position immediately after 'w'.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef find_char_after_rightmost_w(input_string):\n    # Find the index of the rightmost 'w'\n    rightmost_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n    \n    # Ensure the rightmost 'w' is found\n    if rightmost_w_index == -1:\n        return None\n    \n    # Determine the length of the sequence before the rightmost 'w'\n    sequence_length = 0\n    current_char = input_string[rightmost_w_index - 1]\n    \n    while current_char != 'r':\n        if current_char == '0':\n            sequence_length += 1\n        elif current_char == 'i':\n            sequence_length += 2\n        elif current_char == '1':\n            sequence_length += 1\n        current_char = input_string[current_char + 1]\n    \n    # Find the character immediately after the rightmost 'w'\n    post_w_index = rightmost_w_index + sequence_length\n    if post_w_index < len(input_string):\n        return input_string[post_w_index]\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Given input string\ninput_string = \"w0i0i1i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i1w0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0w0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i1w0i1i0i0i1i0w0w0i1r0r0i0i0i1i1i0w1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1w0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0w0r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1w0i0r0i0i1i0i1w0i1i1i0w0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1w0r0i0r0r\"\n\n# Find the character after the rightmost 'w'\nresult = find_char_after_rightmost_w(input_string)\nprint(\"<answer>\" + str(result) + \"</answer>"}

To find the character at position 81, we need to consider the length of each segment of characters (e.g., 'w', 'i', '0', 'r') and sum their lengths until we reach or exceed position 81.\n\n- 'w' has a length of 1\n- 'i' has a length of 1\n- '0' has a length of 1\n- 'r' has a length of 1\n\nSumming these lengths:\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\n\nThis means that every group of four characters (e.g., \"w1i1i0i0\") occupies one position in the string. To find the character at position 81, we need to determine how many full groups of four characters fit into 81 and then find the character in the partial group that spans beyond position 80.\n\n81 divided by 4 is 20 with a remainder of 1. This means there are 20 full groups of four characters, and the character at position 81 is the first character of the 21st group.\n\nThe 21st group starts with \"i0\":\n- The first character in this group is 'i'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The string length is 101 characters. The characters before the rightmost 'w' are:\n\n- 76 characters of 'i' and '0'\n- 1 character 'r'\n- 1 character '1'\n\nSo, the total number of characters before the 'w' is 78 (76 'i' and '0' + 1 'r' + 1 '1').\n\nTherefore, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is the 78th character in the string.\n\nLet's calculate the 78th character:\n\nThe 78th character is the 0-indexed 78th character in the string. Since the string is 101 characters long, the 78th character is the first character of the second line of the string.\n\nThe second line starts with 'i', followed by '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'r', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', 'r', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'w0', 'w0', 'r0', 'i0', 'i1', 'r0', 'i1', 'i1', 'i1', 'r0', 'i0', 'r0', 'i1', 'w0', 'i1', 'i1', 'i0', 'i0', 'r0', 'i1', 'i1', 'i1', 'i0', 'i1' (excluding spaces and punctuation).\n\nThus, the 78th character is 'i'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}

Determine the character immediately after this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput string: w0i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1w1r1r1i1r1i1i0i0w0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0w1i0i0i1i1i0i0r1r1i1w1i1i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i1w0r0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0i1r0w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i1i0i0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at position 77 (0-indexed).\n\nTo find the character immediately after this 'w', we need to consider the string's structure and the positions of the characters. The string is composed of several groups of characters separated by 'i1' and 'r1'. Each group seems to follow a pattern where there are varying numbers of '0', 'i1', and 'r1' characters before the next 'w'.\n\nGiven the complexity of the string pattern, let's use Python to accurately determine the character after the rightmost 'w':\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1w1r1r1i1r1i1i0i0w0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0w1i0i0i1i1i0i0r1r1i1w1i1i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i1w0r0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0i1r0w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i1i0i0i0r\"\n\n# Find the position of the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_position = input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Check if there is a character after the rightmost 'w'\nif rightmost_w_position != -1:\n    # Get the character after the rightmost 'w'\n    after_w_character = input_string[rightmost_w_position + 1]\n    # Convert to the correct character representation\n    after_w_character = after_w_character[0]  # Assuming ASCII representation\nelse:\n    after_w_character = 'N/A'  # Not applicable if no character follows\n\n# Output the result\nanswer = \"<answer>\" + after_w_character + \"</answer>"}

The string length is 128.\n\nSince the string is composed of various characters including digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters, we need to ensure we are looking at the correct sequence after the 'w'. However, given the structure of the string and the fact that it seems to be a mix of random characters, we can infer that the next character will be the first character of the next substring after \"w\".\n\nLet's examine the substring from position 62 to 63:\n\n- The substring before \"w1i0i0i0i0i1\" is \"i1i0i0i0i1\".\n- The first character of the substring \"w1i0i0i0i0i1\" is 'w'.\n\nThus, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
