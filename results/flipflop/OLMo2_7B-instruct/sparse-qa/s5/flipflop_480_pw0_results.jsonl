Determine the character at the position immediately after the last 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\n- The string is composed of various characters, including 'w', 'i', 'r', and spaces.\n- We need to count the number of 'w' characters until we reach the end of the string.\n\nBy manually counting the 'w' characters, we find that the last 'w' appears at position 77.\n\nNext, we look at the character directly after position 77. The string ends at position 102, so the character at position 77 is '0'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Look at the character at the position immediately after the last 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\n- The string starts with 'w' at position 0.\n- The next 'w' appears at position 14.\n- The next 'w' appears at position 28, and so on.\n\nThe pattern shows that each 'w' is separated by 14 characters. The last 'w' in the string is at position 105 (since 105 - 14 = 91, which is the position of the previous 'w').\n\nTo find the character immediately after the last 'w':\n- Count 105 characters from the start of the string.\n- The 105th character is '0'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is **0**.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Determine the digit directly to its right.\n\nLet's break down the string and identify the position of the last 'w':\n\n- The string is composed of various characters, including 'w', 'i', and other digits.\n- We need to count the number of 'w' characters until we reach the last one.\n\nBy manually inspecting the string, we find that the last 'w' appears at the 113th position in the string.\n\nNow, we look at the digit directly to the right of this 'w'. Counting positions from the right, the digit at the 113th position is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>0</answer>"}

This position is out of the string's range since the string length is 81 characters (including spaces).\n\nTherefore, there is no character at position 78. The string ends at position 77 with the character 'r'.\n\nGiven this, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
