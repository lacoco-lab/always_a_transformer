Determine the character at that position.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\nInput string: w1r1i0r1i1w1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r1r1i1i0i0r1i0w1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i1w0i0i1r0r0w1i1i0i0r1w0i1i1i1i0w0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i1i1i0i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1r0i1i0w1i0r1r1i1i0w1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i0w1w1i0i0i0i1i0r\n\nThe last 'w' is at position 81 (0-indexed).\n\nNow, let's determine the character at position 81:\n\nThe string is composed of various characters, including digits (0-9), uppercase letters (A-Z), and lowercase letters (a-z). The pattern of characters seems to be somewhat random, but we can observe that the string is structured with alternating sequences of 'w', digits, and letters.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to consider the structure of the string. Given the complexity of the string, a direct algorithmic approach would involve iterating through the string and accessing the character at the specified position.\n\nHowever, due to the length and complexity of the string, a more efficient approach would be to use a programming language to directly access the character at position 81. Here's a Python snippet to achieve this:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1i0r1i1w1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r1r1i1i0i0r1i0w1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i1w0i0i1r0r0w1i1i0i0r1w0i1i1i1i0w0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i1i1i0i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1r0i1i0w1i0r1r1i1i0w1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i0w1w1i0i0i0i1i0r\"\n\ncharacter_at_position_81 = input_string[80]  # Python uses 0-based indexing\nprint(character_at_position_81)\n```\n\nRunning this code will output the character at position 81 in the string. Based on the provided options:\n\nA. 0\nB. 1\n\nThe character at position 81 is '0'. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The pattern of characters suggests that the string is a mix of random characters, but there is a repeating sequence \"i0i1\" which appears multiple times.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to consider the repeating nature of the sequence \"i0i1\". The length of one complete cycle of \"i0i1\" is 2 characters.\n\nLet's calculate the position within the cycle:\n\\[ \\text{Position within cycle} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{81}{2} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 40 + 1 = 41 \\]\n\nSince 41 is beyond the length of one cycle, we need to consider the next cycle:\n\\[ \\text{Next cycle start} = 81 \\mod 2 = 1 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Position within next cycle} = 1 \\]\n\nThe character at position 1 within the cycle \"i0i1\" is 'i'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The pattern of characters suggests that the string is structured in a way that digits and letters alternate, with occasional 'r' characters interspersed.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to consider the structure of the string. Given the alternating pattern and the presence of 'r' characters, it's likely that the character at position 81 is a digit.\n\nLet's verify this by examining the sequence leading up to position 81:\n\n- The sequence before position 81 includes: 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'w', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '0', 'i', '1', 'w', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'r' (and more)\n\nThe characters in this sequence are 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'i', '0', 'w', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '0', 'i', '1', 'w', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'r'.\n\nThe digit '0' appears at position 71 (0-indexed), and '1' appears at position 77 (0-indexed). The next character after '1' is 'i', which is at position 78 (0-indexed).\n\nGiven the alternating pattern and the sequence, the character at position 81 is most likely a digit. Since the digit '0' is the most recent digit before reaching position 81, it is the correct answer.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>A</answer>"}

The pattern seems to be a mix of these characters with some repetition.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to consider the repeating patterns in the string. The string has a repeating block of \"w0i0i1i1i1r1\" which repeats multiple times.\n\nLet's identify the repeating block and its length:\n- The block \"w0i0i1i1i1r1\" has a length of 6 characters.\n\nTo find the character at position 81:\n1. Determine how many full repetitions of the block fit into 81 characters.\n2. Calculate the remainder to find the exact position within the block.\n\nNumber of full repetitions = 81 // 6 = 13 (full blocks)\nRemainder = 81 % 6 = 3\n\nThe character at position 81 is the 3rd character within the 14th block.\n\nThe 3rd character in the repeating block \"w0i0i1i1i1r1\" is 'i1'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The pattern of characters suggests that the string is structured in a way that non-'w' characters are interspersed with 'w' characters.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to consider the structure of the string. Given the complexity of the string and the variety of characters, a direct lookup might not be straightforward without a clear pattern. However, we can infer that the string is structured in a way that non-'w' characters are interspersed, and the last 'w' is likely followed by another character.\n\nGiven the structure and the nature of the string, the character at position 81 is most likely a digit. By examining the string pattern and the distribution of characters, it appears that the digit '0' is the most plausible character at this position.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The string length is 128.\n\nSince the rightmost 'w' is at position 77, the next character is at position 78.\n\nLet's check the character at position 78:\n\nThe character at position 78 is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
