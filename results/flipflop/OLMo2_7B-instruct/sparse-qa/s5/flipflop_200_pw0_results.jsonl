Given the complexity of the string and the potential for overlapping patterns, a more detailed analysis or a programmatic approach would be ideal.\n\nHowever, for simplicity, let's manually inspect the string up to the 51st character:\n\n- The string starts with 'w', followed by 'i0i1i1r1', then another 'w', and so on.\n- By manually counting, we can see that the pattern 'w' is followed by a block of 'i0i1i1r1' which repeats.\n\nLet's identify the block structure:\n- 'w' -> 'i0i1i1r1' (5 characters)\n- This block repeats, and we need to find where the 51st character falls.\n\nSince 'w' is at position 1 and the block 'i0i1i1r1' is 5 characters long, we calculate the position of the next 'w' within the block:\n- 1 (position of 'w') + 5 (length of 'i0i1i1r1') = 6\n\nThe next 'w' after position 1 would be at position 6, but since we are looking for the **rightmost** 'w', we need to consider the end of the block and the subsequent characters.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's simplify by noting that the string is structured with 'w' followed by a repeating sequence. The rightmost 'w' in a full block of 'i0i1i1r1' is at position 5 within that block.\n\nSince position 51 falls within the repeating sequence but not at the start of a new block, we need to look at the 51st character in the context of the repeating pattern.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the 51st character is part of the 'r1' sequence within the repeating block.\n\nThus, the character at position 51 is 'r'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}

We can observe that the pattern repeats every 4 characters ('000w'). \n\nGiven that the position 81 is within the repeating block '000w', we can determine the character by finding the remainder when 81 is divided by 4:\n\n81 % 4 = 1\n\nThis means position 81 falls within the 'r' in the repeating pattern '000w'.\n\nThus, the character at position 81 is 'r'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}
