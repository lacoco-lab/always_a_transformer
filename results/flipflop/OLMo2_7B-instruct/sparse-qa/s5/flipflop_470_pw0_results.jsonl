Look at the character directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the last 'w':\n\n- The string is quite long, and it contains multiple 'w' characters interspersed with other characters.\n- We will count the occurrences of 'w' until we reach the end of the string.\n\nBy manually inspecting the string, we can see that the last 'w' appears at the 113th position from the start of the string.\n\nNow, we need to look at the character directly to the right of this 'w'. Counting positions from the end, the 114th character is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n```\n<answer>B</answer>"}
