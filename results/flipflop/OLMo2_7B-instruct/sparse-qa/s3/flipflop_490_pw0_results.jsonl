The rightmost 'w' is found at the 113th position (0-indexed).\n\nThe character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is at position 114. Given the string length is 120, the character at position 114 is the 5th character in the word \"i0i0i1i0i0i1i0\".\n\nThe 5th character in \"i0i0i1i0i0i1i0\" is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
