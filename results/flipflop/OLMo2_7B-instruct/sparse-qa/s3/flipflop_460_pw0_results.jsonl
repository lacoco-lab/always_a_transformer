Identify the position of the last 'w'.\n2. Determine the character directly to the right of the last 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\n- The string is composed of various characters, including 'w', digits, and other characters.\n- We need to count the number of 'w' characters until we reach the end of the string.\n\nBy manually counting the occurrences of 'w', we find that the last 'w' appears at the 113th position in the string.\n\nNext, we look at the character directly to the right of the 113th position. This character is 'r'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
