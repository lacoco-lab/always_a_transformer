The next 'w' after the last one found at position 14 will be at:\n\nPosition = 14 + (5 - 1) = 18\n\nNow, let's check the 18th character in the string:\n\n- The characters before the 18th position are: 'i', 'r', 'i', '0', ' '\n- The 18th character is '0'\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
