To find the character at position 113, we need to consider the length of each type of character block:\n\n- 'w' characters: 15\n- '0' to '9' digits: 10\n- 'i' characters (both upper and lower case): 10 * 2 = 20\n\nThe total number of characters before the last 'w' is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ ('w')} + 10 \\text{ ('0' to '9')} + 20 \\text{ ('i') characters} = 45 \\]\n\nSince position 113 is beyond the 45th character, we need to consider the overflow into the next cycle of the character set. The next cycle starts after the digits and 'i' characters, which includes the letters (A-Z).\n\nPosition 46 corresponds to the 17th letter in the alphabet (since 46 - 26 + 1 = 21, and 21st letter is 'v').\n\nHowever, since we are looking for a digit (0-9) or an 'i' character, we need to check if the 113th position falls within the range of these characters.\n\nGiven that the string length is 144 characters (15 'w' + 10 * 2 'i' + 10 '0' to '9' + 1 trailing 'r'), the 113th character is within the range of digits and 'i' characters.\n\nTo confirm, let's check the 113th character explicitly by counting the characters:\n\n- From the start, count 45 characters (as calculated above) to reach the end of the first block.\n- The 113th character is the 68th character in total (since 113 - 45 = 68).\n\n68th character in the string is '0'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The sequence length seems to increase with each 'w'. To find the character at position 77, we need to consider the pattern:\n\n- After 'w1', the sequence is \"1\"\n- After 'w2', the sequence is \"01\"\n- After 'w3', the sequence is \"010\"\n- And so on...\n\nWe observe that the length of the sequence after each 'w' increases by 1 each time. To find the length of the sequence after the 77th 'w', we sum the sequence lengths up to the 77th 'w':\n\nLength of sequence after w77 = Sum of the first 77 natural numbers.\n\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\( n = 77 \\):\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = \\frac{77 \\times 78}{2} = 3003 \\]\n\nSo, the sequence after the 77th 'w' has a length of 3003 characters.\n\nSince we are looking for the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w', we need to consider the 3004th character (because the length is 3003, and indexing starts at 0).\n\nGiven the structure of the string, the 3004th character is part of the next 'w' sequence, which starts with 'w' followed by a sequence of digits. The 3004th character in this sequence will be the first digit of the sequence after 'w'.\n\nThe sequence after 'w3004' starts with \"4\". Therefore, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The pattern seems to be a mix of numbers and letters, but there is no clear repeating pattern that would simplify finding the exact character.\n\nTo accurately find the character at position 81, we need to consider the entire string and its composition. Given the complexity of the string and the absence of a clear repeating pattern, a direct algorithmic approach without additional context or constraints might not be straightforward.\n\nHowever, based on the structure of the string and the characters present, we can infer that the character at position 81 is likely to be a digit, given the prevalence of digits in the string.\n\nThus, the most reasonable answer based on the provided options and the context of the string is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

To find the character at position 113, we need to consider the length of each type of character block:\n\n- 'w' characters: 15\n- '0' digits: 4\n- 'i' lowercase letters: 10\n- Other characters: 1 (the '1' after the last 'w')\n\nSince the total length of the string is 144 characters, we can calculate the position within each block:\n\n- For 'w' characters: \\(113 \\mod 15 = 8\\), so the 8th 'w' is 'w'.\n- For '0' digits: \\(113 \\mod 4 = 3\\), so the 3rd '0' is '0'.\n- For 'i' lowercase letters: \\(113 \\mod 10 = 3\\), so the 3rd 'i' is 'i'.\n- The remaining characters are non-'w', '0', or 'i', which include digits (1 in this case).\n\nGiven that the 3rd 'i' is 'i', and the next character after 'i' is the only remaining character at position 113, which is a digit '1'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
