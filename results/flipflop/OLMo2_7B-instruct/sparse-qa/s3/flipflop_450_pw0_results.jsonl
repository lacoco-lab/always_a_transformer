Determine the character at the position immediately following the last 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\n- The string contains multiple 'w' characters interspersed with other characters.\n- We need to count the number of 'w' characters until we reach the end of the string.\n\nBy manually counting the 'w' characters, we find that the last 'w' appears at position 101.\n\nNext, we look at the character directly to the right of the last 'w'. The character at position 101 is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
