We need to identify the pattern and the character at the 81st position.\n\nUpon examining the string, we notice that the characters repeat in a specific pattern. The repeating unit is \"wir1i0r1\".

We need to identify the character at position 81 by examining the sequence of characters.\n\nGiven the complexity of the string and the mix of characters, a direct algorithmic approach would involve iterating through the string and accessing the character at the specified index. However, due to the length and complexity of the string, a more efficient approach would be to use a programming language to extract the character at position 81.\n\nHere's a Python snippet to find the character:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1r1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0w0i0w0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0w1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i0r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1w0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1i0r0i1r0i0i1i1i1i0r0i1r0r0i1i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1r0i1w0i0i0i1i0w0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i1r0i0r0r0i0i1i1i1w1i0r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r1i0w1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1r\"\n\ncharacter_at_position_81 = input_string[80]  # Python uses 0-based indexing\n\nprint(<answer>Character at position 81: </answer>"}
