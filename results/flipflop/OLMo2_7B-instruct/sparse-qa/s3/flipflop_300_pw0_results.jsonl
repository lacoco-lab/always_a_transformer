The pattern seems to involve alternating between different sequences of characters.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to consider the repeating patterns in the string. The string appears to have a repeating structure, but due to its length, we need to carefully analyze it.\n\nLet's manually count the characters until we reach position 81:\n\n- The first 'w' is at position 81.\n- The sequence before the first 'w' is: w1i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r1i1w0i1r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0w0i0i1i0i0r0r0w1i0i0i1i0r1i1w0i0i0i1w0i0i0i0i0w0i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i0r0r0i0i1i0r0i1i1w1r1i0i0i1i0i0r1w0w0r0i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1r\n\nFrom the manual count, we see that the sequence leading up to the last 'w' is quite long and complex. However, since we know the position of the last 'w' is 81, and considering the repeating nature of the string, we can deduce that the character at position 81 is likely to be a 'w' again due to the repeating pattern.\n\nThus, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Determine the character immediately after this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the rightmost 'w':\n\n```\nInput: w1i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i1i1i1r1i0r1i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0w0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0r0r0i1i1i0w1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1w1i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1w1r1i0r1r\n```\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at position 37.\n\nTo find the character immediately after this 'w', we need to consider the string's structure and the positions of the characters. The string is composed of several groups of characters separated by 'r' characters. Each group seems to follow a pattern where there are 'i' characters followed by a '0' and then more 'i' characters.\n\nLet's analyze the structure:\n- Each group starts with 'w', followed by 'i' characters, a '0', and more 'i' characters.\n- The length of each group seems to vary, but the '0' is always at the end of each group.\n\nGiven the structure, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' (position 37) will be the first character of the next group. Since the last 'w' is at position 37, the next group starts at position 38.\n\nThe next group starts with 'i', followed by '0', and then more 'i' characters. Therefore, the character at position 38 is 'i'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' character in the string.\n2. Determine the character immediately after this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the rightmost 'w':\n\nInput string: w1i1w1i0r1i0i1i1i1i1i0r1i1i0i0i1i1w1i0i1i1i0r1r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i1w0i1i1i0i0r0i1i0r0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i0w0w0i0r0w0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r0r0r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i1w1i0r1i0r1w1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1w1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i1r1i0i0i0r1i1w1i0w1i0r1i0w0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at position 77 (counting from 0).\n\nTo find the character immediately after this 'w', we need to consider the string's structure and the positions of the characters before and after the 'w'. The string is structured with alternating sequences of 'i' and 'r' characters, followed by 'w' characters.\n\nGiven the structure, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' will be an 'r' because:\n- The sequence before the rightmost 'w' is \"i0r1i0i1i1i1i1i0r1i1i0i0i1i1w1i0i1i1i0r1r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i1w0i1i1i1i1r0i0i1w0i1i1i0i0r0i1i0r0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i0w0w0i0r0w0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r0r0r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i1w1i0r1i0r1w1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1w1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i1r1i0i0i0r1i1w1i0w1i0r1i0w0r\".\n\nThe pattern shows that after 'w', the next character is always 'r'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The string is 102 characters long.\n2. The rightmost 'w' is the 102nd character.\n3. To find the character immediately after the 102nd character, we need to consider the length of the string and the positions of the characters.\n\nSince the string is 102 characters long, the index of the character immediately after the 102nd character is `102 + 1 = 103`.\n\nNow, let's determine the 103rd character in the string:\n\n- The string is divided into blocks of characters separated by 'w'.\n- Each block contains 10 characters (except the last block which contains fewer characters due to the presence of 'w').\n\nThe blocks are:\n- w1i1i0i1i1i1r1i0w1i0i0r1w0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0w1r1i0i0r1i1r1i0i0i0w0i1i0w0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1r0w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1r\n\nThe 103rd character falls in the block starting after the last 'w' in the string:\n- The last 'w' is at position 101.\n- The next block starts at position 102 and ends at position 110 (since each block is 10 characters long).\n\nThe 103rd character is the first character of this block:\n- The first character of this block is 'i'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is 'i', which corresponds to option B.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

To find the character at position 77, we calculate the remainder of 77 divided by 3:\n\n77 % 3 = 2\n\nThis means position 77 corresponds to the second 'i' in the repeating sequence 'wr'i.\n\nTherefore, the character at position 77 is 'i'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}
