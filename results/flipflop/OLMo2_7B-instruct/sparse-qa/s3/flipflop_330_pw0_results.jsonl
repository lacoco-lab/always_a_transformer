To find the character at position 81, we need to consider the length of each segment of characters and digits.\n\n- 'w' appears multiple times, followed by various other characters.\n- The longest sequence of 'w' characters is 11, which occurs multiple times.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of 'w' and determine the exact position within the longest sequence:\n\n1. The first occurrence of 'w' is at position 1.\n2. The next 'w' is at position 12 (1 + 11).\n3. The next 'w' is at position 23 (12 + 11).\n4. And so on...\n\nTo find the exact position of the 81st 'w', we calculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Position of 81st 'w'} = 1 + 11 \\times (81 - 1) = 1 + 11 \\times 80 = 1 + 880 = 881 \\]\n\nSince the string length is only 101 characters (as calculated by summing the lengths of all character sequences), the 881st position is out of bounds. This means we need to consider the wrapping around effect in a circular string.\n\nIn a circular string, the position 881 would be equivalent to position 0 (since 881 % 101 = 0).\n\nAt position 0, the character is 'w'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Identify the position of the last 'w' in the string.\n2. Determine the character at that position.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\nInput string: w1i1w1i0r1i1i0i0i0w0i1r0r0i1r0i1r0i0i1i1i0i1r0i1i0r0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i1r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i1w1i0i1i1i1i1i0r1r1r1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0w1i1r1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w1i0w1i1i1i1r1i0w1i1i0i0i1i0\n\nThe last 'w' is at position 81 (0-indexed).\n\nNow, let's determine the character at position 81:\n\nThe string is composed of various characters, including digits and uppercase letters. To find the character at position 81, we need to consider the length of each segment of characters before and after the 'w' characters.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the string structure:\n- 'w' characters: w1, w1i0, w1i1, w1i0, w0, w1r0, w1r0r0, w1r0i1, ..., w1i0\n- Non-'w' characters: i1, i0, r1, i1i0, i0i0, r1i1, i1i0, r1r1, i1i0, r0, r0r0, r0i1, ..., i0\n\nThe 'w' characters are interspersed with other characters, and we need to count the total number of characters before reaching the last 'w'. \n\nLet's count the characters before the last 'w':\n- The pattern \"w1i1w1i0\" repeats multiple times.\n- Each \"w1i1w1i0\" segment contains 5 characters: w1, i1, w1, i0, r1.\n- The sequence \"w0\" contains 2 characters.\n- The sequence \"w1r0\" contains 3 characters.\n- The sequence \"w1r0r0\" contains 4 characters.\n- The sequence \"w1r0i1\" contains 5 characters.\n- And so on...\n\nWe need to find the position where the cumulative count of characters before the 'w' reaches 80 (since position 81 is the next character).\n\nLet's calculate the cumulative count:\n\n1. \"w1i1w1i0\": 5 characters\n2. \"w0\": 2 characters\n3. \"w1r0\": 3 characters\n4. \"w1r0r0\": 4 characters\n5. \"w1r0i1\": 5 characters\n\nAdding these up:\n5 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 19 characters\n\nNow, we need to determine how many more characters are needed to reach 80:\n80 - 19 = 61 characters\n\nThe next segment that we need to consider is \"w1i1w1i1i0\" (which is 8 characters long).\n\nAdding these 8 characters to the previous total:\n19 + 8 = 27 characters\n\nWe still need:\n80 - 27 = 53 characters\n\nThe next segment is \"w1i1i0i0i0i0w0\" (which is 10 characters long).\n\nAdding these 10 characters:\n27 + 10 = 37 characters\n\nWe still need:\n80 - 37 = 43 characters\n\nThe next segment is \"w1i1i0r1i1i0i0i0r1i0\" (which is 13 characters long).\n\nAdding these 13 characters:\n37 + 13 = 50 characters\n\nFinally, we reach the last 'w' at position 81 with:\n50 + 1 = 51 characters before it.\n\nSince we need 51 characters to reach the last 'w' and the position 81 corresponds to the character after the last 'w', the character at position 81 is the first character of the next segment.\n\nThe next segment starts with \"i1i1i0r1r1i1i0i1i0w1i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0\" which is 23 characters long.\n\nTherefore, the character at position 81 is the 23rd character in this segment, which is 'i1'.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Given the complexity of the string and the absence of a clear repeating pattern, a direct algorithmic approach without manual inspection would be inefficient.\n\nHowever, based on the structure of the string and the characters preceding the last 'w', it appears that the characters before the last 'w' are composed of a mix of digits and lowercase letters. The last 'w' is followed by a mix of characters, including digits and uppercase letters.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for manual verification, let's manually inspect the string to find the character at position 81:\n\nThe 81st character in the string is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The string appears to be segmented into blocks of characters, and within each block, the characters repeat in a certain pattern.\n\nLet's analyze the structure:\n- The first block is \"w1r1i0i1i0r1i1i0i1i0\" (length 9)\n- The second block is \"w0i0r0i0i1i1i0i1i0w\" (length 9)\n- The third block is \"0i0r0i1i1i0i0i0i0r\" (length 8)\n- The fourth block is \"1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i\" (length 8)\n- And so on...\n\nEach block's length decreases by 1 as we move forward. The pattern repeats every few blocks, but we are only concerned with the immediate context around the last 'w'.\n\nGiven the decreasing lengths and the structure, the character at position 81 falls within the third block (since the third block is the longest among the immediate surrounding blocks).\n\nThe third block is \"0i0r0i1i1i0i0i0i0r\", and the character at position 8 (since positions are 0-indexed) is '0'.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

However, given the complexity and randomness of the string, a direct algorithmic approach without additional context or a specific pattern recognition algorithm might not be straightforward.\n\nGiven the nature of the problem and the provided options (A. 0 or B. 1), it's reasonable to infer that the answer should be a digit. Since the string is structured with alternating characters and considering the randomness, the digit at position 81 is likely to be one of the digits present in the string.\n\nBy examining the string, we can see that digits do appear in the sequence, and since the position is relatively high, it's plausible that the digit at this position is one of the lower digits (0-9).\n\nGiven the options and the nature of the problem, the most reasonable answer based on the provided choices and the structure of the string is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
