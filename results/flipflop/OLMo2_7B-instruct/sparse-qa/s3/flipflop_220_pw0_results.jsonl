The string is composed of alternating sequences of digits and characters, with the pattern repeating every 10 characters.\n\nThe repeating pattern is:\n```\nw0i0r0\n```\n\nEach full pattern (10 characters) includes:\n- 1 'w'\n- 0 'i'\n- 0 'r'\n\nThus, every 10 characters, there is exactly 1 'w'.\n\nTo find the character at the 113th position:\n1. Calculate the remainder when 113 is divided by 10: \\(113 \\mod 10 = 3\\).\n2. The remainder tells us the position within the repeating pattern:\n   - 0 corresponds to the first 'w' in the pattern.\n   - 1 corresponds to the second 'w'.\n   - 2 corresponds to the third 'w', and so on.\n\nSince 3 corresponds to the third 'w' in the pattern, the character at the 113th position is the second 'w' in the repeating unit.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The string is composed of several segments separated by 'w'. Each segment starts with a 'w' and is followed by a sequence of digits and possibly more characters.\n\nGiven the complexity of the string, a direct extraction without parsing might lead to errors due to the irregular structure. However, since we are specifically asked for the character after the rightmost 'w', we can simplify our approach by focusing on the immediate context around the last 'w'.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the string ends with a series of characters that do not include another 'w'. Therefore, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is the first character of the string following the last 'w', which is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The string is composed of several groups of characters separated by 'w'. Each group seems to follow a pattern of alternating '0's and 'i's, followed by a 'w'.\n\nLet's calculate the length of each group:\n- The first group: `w0i0i0i1w0i1i1i1i1` has 7 characters.\n- The second group: `r0i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i0w0i0` has 11 characters.\n- The third group: `w0i0w0i1r0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1r0r0` has 15 characters.\n\nThe total length of these groups is:\n\\[ 7 + 11 + 15 = 33 \\]\n\nSince the string is 113 characters long, there are 80 characters left after accounting for the three groups.\n\nGiven the pattern, these remaining 80 characters are likely to follow the same alternating '0's and 'i's pattern as the first group. Therefore, the 113th character will be the 4th 'i' in this pattern (since \\( 80 \\div 7 = 11 \\) full groups with a remainder of 3, and the 3rd 'i' in the next partial group).\n\nThus, the 113th character is the 4th 'i' in the sequence 'i0i0i1'.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The string length is 128.\n\nSince the string is composed of various characters including digits and letters, we need to ensure we are looking at the correct sequence after the 'w'. However, given the structure of the string and the fact that it seems to be a mix of alphanumeric characters, we can infer that the next character will be determined by the immediate context.\n\nGiven the complexity of the string and the need for an algorithmic approach, let's simplify by examining the pattern around the 'w'. The string appears to be structured in a way that might repeat certain sequences. However, without a clear repeating pattern or additional constraints, a direct algorithmic approach might involve checking the immediate preceding characters and their impact on the next character.\n\nFor simplicity and based on the provided options (A. 0 or B. 1), let's manually inspect the immediate context around the rightmost 'w':\n\n- The sequence before the rightmost 'w' is \"i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1r1i1i0w1i1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i1i1i0w1i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1w0i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i1r0r0i0w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1w0i1i1w0i1w0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i1r0i0w1i0i0i1i0r\".\n\n- The immediate preceding characters to the rightmost 'w' are \"i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1r1i1i0w1i1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i1i1i0w1i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1w0i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i1r0r0i0w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1w0i1i1w0i1w0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i1r0i0w1i0i0i1i0r\".\n\nThe sequence \"i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1r1i1i0\" directly precedes the 'w'. The 'i' characters dominate this sequence, and the 'r' characters appear less frequently. Given this context, the immediate next character after 'w' is more likely to be influenced by the 'i' characters.\n\nThus, based on the immediate context and the options provided, the most likely character after the rightmost 'w' is an 'i'.
