Look at the character directly to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's break down the string and find the position of the last 'w':\n\n- The string is composed of various characters, including 'w', digits, and other characters.\n- We need to count the number of 'w' characters until we reach the last one.\n\nBy manually inspecting the string, we find that the last 'w' is the 115th character in the string.\n\nNow, we need to look at the character immediately after the 115th 'w'. Counting from the end of the string, the 116th character is '0'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}
