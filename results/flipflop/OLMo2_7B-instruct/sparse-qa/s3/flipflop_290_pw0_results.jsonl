The string is composed of several segments separated by 'i' characters. We need to determine the length of each segment and then find the character at the position immediately after the 'w'.\n\nLet's count the 'i' characters before the rightmost 'w' to determine the length of the segment:\n\n- The 'i' before the rightmost 'w' is at position 84.\n- The 'i' before that is at position 83, and so on.\n\nCounting the 'i' characters:\n- From position 84 to the end (position 85), there is 1 'i'.\n- From position 83 to 84, there is 1 'i'.\n- From position 82 to 83, there is 1 'i'.\n- This pattern continues until position 1.\n\nTotal number of 'i' characters before the rightmost 'w' is 84 + 1 = 85.\n\nSince each 'i' represents a segment boundary and each segment starts with a 'w' followed by a sequence of 'i' characters, the length of the segment before the rightmost 'w' is 85.\n\nThe position immediately after the rightmost 'w' (position 85) falls within the next segment. The next segment starts with 'w' at position 86 and continues with 'i' characters until the next 'w'.\n\nGiven the structure, the character at position 86 is 'i'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>B</answer>"}

The pattern seems to be a mix of these characters with some repetition.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to consider the repeating patterns in the string. The string has a repeating pattern of \"i0i1r1\" followed by \"w0i0r0i1i1r0\".\n\nLet's identify the repeating block:\n- \"i0i1r1\" (4 characters)\n- \"w0i0r0i1i1r0\" (7 characters)\n\nThe total length of one complete cycle is 4 + 7 = 11 characters.\n\nTo find the character at position 81:\n- Calculate the remainder when 81 is divided by the length of the repeating block (11): 81 % 11 = 10.\n\nThis means the character at position 81 corresponds to the 10th position within the repeating block \"i0i1r1w0i0r0i1i1r0\".\n\nStarting from the beginning of the repeating block:\n- 1st position: 'i'\n- 2nd position: '0'\n- 3rd position: 'i'\n- 4th position: '1'\n- 5th position: 'r'\n- 6th position: '1'\n- 7th position: 'w'\n- 8th position: '0'\n- 9th position: 'i'\n- 10th position: 'r'\n\nThus, the character at position 81 is 'r'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>B</answer>"}

The sequence length seems to increase with each 'w'. To find the character at position 81, we need to consider the pattern:\n\n- After 'w0', the sequence is \"i1i0\" (3 characters)\n- After 'w1', the sequence is \"i1i0i1\" (4 characters)\n- After 'w2', the sequence is \"i1i0i1i0\" (5 characters)\n- And so on...\n\nThe pattern increases by 1 character each time a 'w' is encountered.\n\nTo find the sequence length at position 81:\n- Starting from 'w0': sequence length is 3\n- Adding 1 for each subsequent 'w': 3 + 4 + 5 + ... + (position - 1)\n\nThe position 81 corresponds to the sequence starting after 'w77' (since 81 - 3 = 78, and 78th 'w' is 'w77').\n\nThe sequence length at position 81 is therefore 78 + 3 = 81.\n\nSince the sequence length is 81, which matches the position exactly, the character at position 81 is the first character of the sequence following 'w77', which is 'i1'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
