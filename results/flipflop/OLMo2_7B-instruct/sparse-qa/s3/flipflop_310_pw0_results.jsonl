We can observe that:\n- '0' appears every 3 characters.\n- 'r' appears every 2 characters.\n- 'i' appears every 4 characters.\n- 'w' appears every 5 characters.\n\nTo find the character at position 81, we need to consider the pattern and the cumulative count of characters leading up to position 81.\n\nLet's calculate the cumulative count of characters:\n\n- From the start (position 0) to position 81, there are 81 characters.\n- The pattern repeats every 12 characters (0r0i0w0).\n\nWithin 12 characters:\n- '0' appears 4 times.\n- 'r' appears 2 times.\n- 'i' appears 3 times.\n- 'w' appears 1 time.\n\nTo find the exact character at position 81, we need to determine the remainder when 81 is divided by 12:\n\n81 mod 12 = 9\n\nThis tells us that we are at the 9th cycle of the 12-character pattern.\n\nIn the 9th cycle:\n- '0' appears at positions 0, 3, 6, 9 (4 times).\n- 'r' appears at positions 1, 4, 7, 10 (4 times).\n- 'i' appears at positions 2, 5, 8, 11 (4 times).\n- 'w' appears at position 12 (1 time).\n\nSince position 81 is the 9th cycle plus the initial offset, we look at the 9th '0' in the cycle:\n\nThe 9th '0' is at position 9 within the 12-character cycle.\n\nThus, the character at position 81 in the original string is '0'.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>A</answer>"}
