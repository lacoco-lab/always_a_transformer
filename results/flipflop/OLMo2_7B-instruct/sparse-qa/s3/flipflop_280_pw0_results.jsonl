To find the 38th character, we observe the pattern:\n\n- The sequence '0' appears 15 times.\n- The sequence 'i' appears 20 times.\n- The sequence 'w' appears 16 times.\n- The sequence 'r' appears 10 times.\n\nThe total number of characters is 101.\n\nGiven the repeating pattern, we can determine the character at position 38 by looking at the repeating block:\n\nThe repeating block is: \"0i0w0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i1w1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r1i0w0i1i0i0r0r0i1w1i0r1i1i0w0i1w0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i0i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1w1r1i1i1i0i1r\"\n\nThe repeating block length is 21 characters.\n\nSince position 38 is within the repeating block, we calculate the offset within the block:\n\n38 mod 21 = 17\n\nThis means the 38th character corresponds to the 17th character in the repeating block.\n\nThe 17th character in the repeating block is '0'.\n\nThus, the digit after the **rightmost** 'w' character is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
