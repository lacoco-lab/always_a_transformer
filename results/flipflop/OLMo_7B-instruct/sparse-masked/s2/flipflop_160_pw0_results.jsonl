We can replace it with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe masked sequence is: <sequence_start>w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i0r0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0w1<masked_digit>i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0r1r1i0i0i1i0i1r1i1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0i1i1r</sequence_start>\n\nSo, the final output is:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i0r0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0w1<masked_digit>i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0r1r1i0i0i1i0i1r1i1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0i1i1r</sequence_end><sequence_end>"}
