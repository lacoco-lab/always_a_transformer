Then, we can replace the digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Find the index of the rightmost 'w':\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at index 'i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0w0i0w0i0i1i1w0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1w0i0i1r0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r0r0i0i0i0r'.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at index 'i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0'.\n\n2. Extract the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n\nThe digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n3. Replace the digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag:\n\nThe masked sequence is:\n\n'<sequence_start><masked_digit>0i0w0i0i1i1w0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1w0i0i1r0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r0r0i0i0i0r'\n\nSo, the masked sequence is:\n\n'<sequence_start><masked_digit>0i0w0i0i1i1w0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1w0i0i1r0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r0r0i0i0i0r'\n\nThe masked sequence is now between the <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
