Extract the characters before the rightmost 'w' character:\n```\npre_rightmost_w_sequence = Input[:index_of_rightmost_w]\n```\n3. Extract the digit after the rightmost 'w' character:\n```\ndigit_after_rightmost_w = Input[index_of_rightmost_w + 1 : index_of_rightmost_w + 2]\n```\n4. Replace the digit after the rightmost 'w' character with '<masked_digit>':\n```\nInput = Input.replace(digit_after_rightmost_w, '<masked_digit>')\n```\nNow, let's put everything together:\n\n```python\nInput = \"w1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0r\"\n\nindex_of_rightmost_w = Input.rindex('w')\npre_rightmost_w_sequence = Input[:index_of_rightmost_w]\ndigit_after_rightmost_w = Input[index_of_rightmost_w + 1 : index_of_rightmost_w + 2]\n\nInput = pre_rightmost_w_sequence + '<masked_digit>' + Input[index_of_rightmost_w + 2:]\n\nprint(f\"<sequence_start>{Input}</sequence_end>\")\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\n<sequence_start>w1r1i0i0i0i0r1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0<masked_digit>r</sequence_end>\n```\n\nAs you can see, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character has been masked with '<masked_digit>'.<sequence_end>"}

Then, we can replace the digit after it with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nIn the given input string, the rightmost 'w' character is at index 20. The digit after it is '1'.\n\nNow, we can replace the digit with the <masked_digit> tag:\n\n`w1i1i1r1r1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0r` (without the <masked_digit> tag)\n\n`w1i1i1r1r1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0<masked_digit>` (with the <masked_digit> tag)\n\nSo, the masked sequence is:\n\n`<sequence_start>w1i1i1r1r1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0<masked_digit><sequence_end>"}
