The last \"write\" in the string is \"write1\".\n4. To get the digit after \"write1\", we need to extract the digit from \"write1\".\n5. \"write1\" consists of \"w\", \"i\", \"t\", \"h\", \"1\".\n6. The digit \"1\" is after the last \"write\" in the string.\n7. Therefore, the output is \"1\"."}

The last \"read\" instruction in each group is identified. In the first group, the last \"read\" instruction is \"read0\". In the second group, the last \"read\" instruction is \"read0\".\n3. The characters following the last \"read\" instruction in each group are extracted. In the first group, the characters following \"read0\" are \"write0\". In the second group, the characters following \"read0\" are \"ignore0read0\".\n4. The second character from the right in each extracted sequence is selected. In the first group, the second character from the right is \"0\". In the second group, the second character from the right is \"0\".\n5. The two selected digits are combined to form the answer: <answer>00</answer> with the second character from the right being \"0\".\n6.
