The input string is \"write1read1ignore1ignore0ignore1ignore0read1read1write1read\".\n2. We need to find the last \"write\" instruction in the string. The last \"write\" instruction is \"write1\".\n3. To find the digit after the \"write\" instruction, we need to look to the right of the \"write\" instruction. In this case, the digit after \"write1\" is \"1\".\n4. Therefore, the output is \"1\"."}
