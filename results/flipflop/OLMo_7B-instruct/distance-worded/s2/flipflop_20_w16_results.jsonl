The input string is \"write1ignore1ignore0read1read1read1read1write0read\".\n2. We need to find the last \"write\" instruction in the string. In this case, the last \"write\" instruction is \"write1\".\n3. To find the digit after the \"write\" instruction, we need to look to the right of the \"write\" instruction. In this case, the digit after \"write1\" is \"1\".\n4. So, the output is \"1\", but we need to remove the \"w\" and \"r\" characters before it, which leaves us with \"0\". Therefore, the final answer is \"0\"."}

The string is divided into groups of words that contain the instruction \"write\" and \"read\". In this case, there are two groups: \"write1read1ignore0read1read1read1read1write1\" and \"read\".\n2. The second group (\"read\") contains the last instruction, which is \"read\".\n3. The last digit in the \"read\" instruction is \"1\".\n4. Therefore, the output is \"1\"."}
