The string is \"write0read0read0read0ignore0read0write1ignore1ignore1\"\n2. The last \"write\" instruction in the string is the second one, which is \"write1\"\n3. To find the digit after the \"write\" instruction, we need to look at the character right after \"write1\". In this case, the character after \"write1\" is \"r\".\n4. Since \"r\" is not a digit, we look for the last digit before the \"write\" instruction. The last digit before \"write1\" is \"0\".\n5.
