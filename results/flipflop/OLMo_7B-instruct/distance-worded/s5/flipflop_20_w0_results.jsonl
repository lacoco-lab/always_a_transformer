The string is \"write1read1read1ignore1read1ignore1read1read1read\".\n2. The last \"write\" instruction in the string is the sixth character, which is \"w\".\n3. The sixth character after the last \"write\" instruction is the seventh character, which is \"r\".\n4. The seventh character after the last \"write\" instruction is the eighth character, which is \"t\".\n5.

The last occurrence of \"write\" in the string is at the index 19.\n4. In the substring from index 19 to the end of the string, we find the substring \"read0read\".\n5. The last digit in the substring \"read0read\" is \"0\" (at index 20).\n6. Therefore, the last digit after the last \"write\" instruction is \"0\" (at index 20). But since there is another \"read\" instruction after \"0\", we need to find the next \"read\" instruction after \"0\".\n7. The next \"read\" instruction after \"0\" is at the index 23.\n8. The last digit in the substring from index 23 to the end of the string is \"1\" (at index 24).\n9. Therefore, the output digit is \"1\"."}

The string is divided into groups of characters based on the instructions:\n   - write1, read1, ignore0, read1, read1, ignore1, read1, read1, ignore0, read\n   \n2. The last group of characters in each instruction is considered:\n   - write1, read1, ignore0, read1, read1, ignore1, read1, read1, ignore0, read\n   \n3. The last character in each group is extracted:\n   - w, r, i, r, r, i, r, r, i, r, r\n   \n4. The final digit is returned:\n   - r, r, r, r, r, i, r, r, i, r, r\n   - r, r, r, r, r, i, r, r = 1\n\nTherefore, the output digit is 1."}
