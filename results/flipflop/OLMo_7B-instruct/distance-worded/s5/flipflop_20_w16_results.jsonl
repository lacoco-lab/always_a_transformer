The input string is \"write0ignore0ignore0ignore0ignore1read0ignore1ignore1write1read\".\n2. We need to find the last occurrence of \"write\" in the string.\n3. The last \"write\" in the string is \"write1\".\n4. To get the digit after \"write1\", we need to extract the digit from \"write1\".\n5. \"write1\" contains the digit \"1\".\n6. So, the output is \"1\"."}

The input string is \"write0ignore0ignore1read0read0read0ignore0ignore1write0read\".\n2. We need to find the last \"write\" instruction in the string. The last \"write\" instruction is \"write0\".\n3. To find the digit after the \"write\" instruction, we need to look to the right of the \"write\" instruction. In this case, the digit after \"write0\" is \"0\".\n4. The last digit after the last \"write\" instruction is \"0\".\n5. The last digit we are looking for is \"1\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <answer>1</answer>"}

The string is divided into groups of instructions based on the \"read\" and \"write\" instructions.\n2. The last \"write\" instruction group is \"write1\".\n3. The last character in the \"write\" instruction group is \"1\".\n4. The digit \"1\" is returned as the answer."}

The input string is \"write0read0ignore1read0read0read0ignore1read0write0read\".\n2. We need to find the last \"read\" instruction in the string.\n3. The last \"read\" instruction is \"read0\".\n4. The digit after \"read0\" is \"0\".\n5. The last digit after \"read\" is \"0\".\n6. Therefore, the answer is \"0\" and the last digit after the last \"read\" instruction is \"1\".\n7. Since the answer is \"1\", we can write it as \"<answer>1</answer>\"."}
