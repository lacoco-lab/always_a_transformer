The string is divided into groups of characters based on the instructions:\n   - write1, ignore0, ignore1, read1, ignore1, read1, read\n2. The last group of characters in each instruction group is extracted:\n   - write1, read1, read\n3. The last character in each extracted group is selected:\n   - w, r, r\n4. The desired digit is found:\n   - The fourth character is 'r', which represents the third digit 'r' in the word \"read\".\n   - So, the output digit is '3', which is the third digit in the word \"read\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is <answer>3</answer>."}
