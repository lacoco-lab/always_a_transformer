The input string is \"write0read0ignore0ignore0write1ignore1read1read1read\".\n2. We need to find the last \"write\" instruction in the string. The last \"write\" instruction is \"write1\".\n3. The digit after the \"write\" instruction is the second character of the instruction, which is \"1\".\n4. Therefore, the output is \"1\"."}
