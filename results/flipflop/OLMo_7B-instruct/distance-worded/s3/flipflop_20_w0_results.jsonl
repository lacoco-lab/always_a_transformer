The string is divided into groups of characters based on the instructions:\n   - write1, ignore1, read1, ignore0, read1, read1, read\n   \n2. The last instruction in each group is considered:\n   - write1, read1, read1, read\n   \n3. The last character of each instruction is extracted:\n   - w, r, r, r\n   \n4. The digit value of each character is obtained:\n   - 4, 1, 1, 1\n   \n5. The final output is the last digit:\n   - 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10, the last digit is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is <answer>1</answer>."}

The input string is \"write0ignore1ignore1ignore0read0ignore0read0read0ignore1read\".\n2. We need to find the last occurrence of the substring \"write\" in the string.\n3. The last occurrence of \"write\" in the string is at the index 12.\n4. In the substring from index 12 to the end of the string, we can see the digits \"0010010\".\n5. The last digit in this substring is \"0\".\n6. Therefore, the answer is \"0\"."}
