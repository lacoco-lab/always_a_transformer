In the third group, the last \"read\" is at index 16. In the fourth group, the last \"read\" is at index 18.\n3. The characters following each \"read\" instruction are extracted. In the first group, the character following the \"read\" at index 8 is \"0\". In the second group, the character following the \"read\" at index 12 is \"0\". In the third group, the character following the \"read\" at index 16 is \"0\". In the fourth group, the character following the \"read\" at index 18 is \"0\".\n4.

The last \"read\" instruction in each group is identified. In this case, the last \"read\" instructions are \"read1\", \"read1\", \"read1\", \"read1\", \"read1\", \"read1\".\n3. The digit in the last \"read\" instruction in each group is extracted. In this case, the digits are \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\".\n4. The final output is the sum of the digits in the last \"read\" instruction. In this case, the sum is \"4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7\". However, since we are looking for the digit after the last \"write\" instruction, we need to look at the next digit after the last \"write\" instruction.\n5. The last \"write\" instruction in the string is \"write0\". The next digit after it is \"0\". Therefore, the output is \"0\"."}

The last \"write\" instruction is \"write0\".\n3. To find the digit after the \"write\" instruction, we need to look at the character to the right of \"write0\". The character to the right of \"write0\" is \"0\".\n4. Therefore, the digit after the last \"write\" instruction is \"0\".\n5. However, since we are looking for the last \"write\" instruction, we can also find the digit after the \"write1\" instruction, which is \"1\".\n6. In this case, since there is only one \"write\" instruction in the string, the answer is \"1\"."}

The string is divided into groups of words based on the presence of \"write\" and \"read\" instructions.\n2. The last \"read\" instruction in each group is identified.\n3. The digit in the last \"read\" instruction is extracted.\n\nThe string is divided into the following groups:\n\nwrite1ignore0ignore1read1ignore0ignore1ignore0read1write1read\n\nwrite1ignore0ignore1ignore0read1write1read\n\nThe last \"read\" instruction in each group is:\n\nread1\nread1\n\nThe digit in the last \"read\" instruction is:\n\n1\n1\n\nThe output is:\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
