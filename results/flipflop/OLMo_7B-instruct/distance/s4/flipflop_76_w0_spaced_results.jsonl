To find the last 'w' character, we need to count backwards from the end of the string. Here's how we can do it step by step:\n\n1. Start at the end of the string (rightmost character).\n2. Check if the character is 'w'.\n3. If it is, move one character to the left and repeat steps 1-3.\n4. If it's not 'w', we've reached the end of the string.\n\nFollowing this process, we find that the last 'w' character is in the 8th position from the end (counting backwards from the rightmost character).\n\nNow, we need to find the digit after this 'w' character. The character after the 'w' is 'r', and the next character after that is '1'. So, the output digit is '1'.\n\nHere's the code to find the last 'w' character and the digit after it:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0"}
