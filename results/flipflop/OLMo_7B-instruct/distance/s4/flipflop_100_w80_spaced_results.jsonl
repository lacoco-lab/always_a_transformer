Therefore, the output is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>\n\nExplanation: The last 'r' in the string is at the position '62' (62 is the ASCII code for 'r'). To find the digit to the right of 'r', we can move one position to the right and check if it is a digit. In this case, the digit to the right of 'r' is '0', which is the last digit after the last 'w' character. Therefore, the output is '0'."}
