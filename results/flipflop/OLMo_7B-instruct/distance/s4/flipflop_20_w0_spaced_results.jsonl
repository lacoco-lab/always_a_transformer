The last character of the string is 'i', which is not an 'w'. Therefore, the last 'w' character in the string is the fifth character from the beginning. The sixth character from the beginning is a 'r', which is not after the 'w'. The seventh character from the beginning is a 'w'. The eighth character from the beginning is a '0', which is the digit we are looking for. So, the output is '0'."}
{"id": 99, "prompt": "w0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r", "answer": 0, "flipflop": "w0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0", "last_valid_token": 0, "last_write_index": 0, "full_answer": "<answer>0</answer>\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n2. Get the characters from the last 'w' index to the end of the string.\n3. Convert the characters to an integer.\n4. Return the digit from the integer.\n\nThe last 'w' index is at the position 22. The characters from the last 'w' index to the end of the string are 'r0r'. Converting 'r0r' to integer gives 12. The digit in the integer 12 is '2'. So, the output digit is '2'.\n\nThe final result is <answer>2</answer>."}
