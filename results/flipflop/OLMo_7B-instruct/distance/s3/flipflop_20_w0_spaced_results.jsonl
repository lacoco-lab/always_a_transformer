The last character of the string is 'r', which is not an 'w'. Therefore, the last 'w' character in the string is the fifth character from the beginning. To extract the digit after this 'w', we can extract the sixth character from the right side of this 'w'. The sixth character from the right side of 'w' is '0'. So, the output digit is '0'."}
{"id": 97, "prompt": "w0i0i1r0i1i0i0i1i0r", "answer": 0, "flipflop": "w0i0i1r0i1i0i0i1i0r0", "last_valid_token": 0, "last_write_index": 0, "full_answer": "<answer>0</answer>\n\nExplanation: In the given string, there is only one 'w' character which is the fourth character from the beginning. The last character of the string is 'r', which is not a 'w' character. Therefore, the last 'w' character in the string is the fourth character from the beginning. The digit after the 'w' character in the fourth position is '0'. So, the output is '0'."}
{"id": 98, "prompt": "w1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r", "answer": 0, "flipflop": "w1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1", "last_valid_token": 1, "last_write_index": 0, "full_answer": "<answer>0</answer>\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n2. Get the characters from the last 'w' index to the end of the string.\n3. Convert the characters to an integer.\n4. Return the digit from the integer.\n\nThe last 'w' index is at position 20, and the characters from that index to the end of the string are 'r1r1r'. Converting 'r1r1r' to integer gives 12, and the digit after the last 'w' is 0. Therefore, the output is 0."}
{"id": 99, "prompt": "w0i1i1i0r0i0r0r0i1r", "answer": 0, "flipflop": "w0i1i1i0r0i0r0r0i1r0", "last_valid_token": 0, "last_write_index": 0, "full_answer": "<answer>0</answer>\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n2. Get the characters from the last 'w' index to the end of the string.\n3. Convert the characters to an integer.\n4. Return the digit from the integer.\n\nThe last 'w' index is at position 20. The characters from the last 'w' index to the end of the string are 'r0i0r0r0i1r'. Converting these characters to an integer gives us 2080. The digit in the ones place is 0. Therefore, the output is <answer>0</answer>."}
