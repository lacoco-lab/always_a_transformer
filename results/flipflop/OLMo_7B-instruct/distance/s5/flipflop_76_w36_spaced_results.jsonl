The digit after this character is the number '1' in the 22nd character position. To extract this digit, we can use string indexing. Here's the code to extract the digit:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0w1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1i1r1i1i0i0r1i0r1r1r1r\"\nlast_w_index = input_string.rindex(\"w\")\ndigit_after_last_w = input_string[last_w_index+1:][0]\nprint(digit_after_last_w)\n```\n\nOutput: <answer>1</answer>\n\nSo, the digit after the last 'w' character in the given input string is '1'."}
