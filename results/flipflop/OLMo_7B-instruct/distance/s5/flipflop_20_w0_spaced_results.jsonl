Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n2. Calculate the position of the last 'w' character + 1 (since indices in Python start at 0, and we need to include it in the character).\n3. Convert the character at that position to its corresponding integer value (using ord() function).\n4. Return the integer value as a character (using chr() function).\n\nThe last 'w' character's index is 14, and its position + 1 is 15. The character at position 15 is '1'. Therefore, the digit after the last 'w' character is '1'."}

Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n2. Get the substring from the index of the last 'w' character + 1 (which is the second character after the 'w') to the end of the string.\n3. Extract the last digit from the substring.\n\nHere's the code to implement the solution:\n\n```python\ndef get_last_digit(input_string):\n    last_w_index = input_string.rindex('w')\n    substring = input_string[last_w_index + 1:len(input_string)]\n    last_digit = substring[-1]\n    return last_digit\n\ninput_string = \"w1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r\"\nprint(get_last_digit(input_string))\n```\n\nThe output is:\n\n```\n0\n```\n\nSo, the digit after the last 'w' character in the given string is '0'."}

The last character of the string is 'r', which is not 'w'. Therefore, the last 'w' character is the 6th character from the right end. The digit after this 'w' character is the second character from the right end, which is '0'. So, the output is '0'."}
