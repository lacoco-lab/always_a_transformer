To find the last occurrence of 'w', we can use the indexOf method and then calculate the index of the last character in the string using the difference between the index of 'w' and the index of 'w' plus the length of 'w'. Finally, we can extract the digit from the last character using charAt.\n\nHere's the code to extract the digit:\n\n```java\nString input = \"w0i0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0r0r0i0i0r0i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0i0i1r0i0w0i1i0r0i1i1r0r0r0r\";\n\nint indexOfW = input.indexOf('w');\nint lastIndex = input.length() - input.substring(indexOfW.toString()).getBytes().length;\nchar lastChar = input.charAt(lastIndex);\n\nint lastDigit = Character.getNumericValue(lastChar);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"<answer>\" + lastDigit + \"</answer>\");\n```\n\nThe output is:"}
