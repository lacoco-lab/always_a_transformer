The last 'w' character is at the index '72'. The character at the index '73' is 'r'. So, the last digit before the last 'w' character is '3'.\n\nTo get the digit after the last 'w', we need to extract the character at the index '72' and then extract the last digit from that character. The character at the index '72' is 'r'. The last digit of 'r' is '2'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is <answer>2</answer>."}
