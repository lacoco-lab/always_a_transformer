The string is \"write1read1ignore0ignore1read\".\n2. The \"write\" instructions tell us to replace a character with another character. In this case, \"write1\" replaces \"1\" with \"w\", \"write0\" replaces \"0\" with \"w\", and \"write1\" replaces \"1\" with \"w\" again.\n3. After following the \"write\" instructions, the string becomes \"wread1ignorewignore1read\".\n4. The \"read\" instructions tell us to replace a character with the next character in the string. In this case, \"read1\" replaces \"1\" with \"w\", \"read\" replaces the next character with the next character in the string, and \"read1\" replaces \"1\" with \"w\" again.\n5. After following the \"read\" instructions, the string becomes \"wwread1ignorewignore1read\".\n6. The last \"read\" instruction replaces the next character with the next character in the string, which is \"r\".\n7. Therefore, the last digit in the string is \"1\".\n8. The answer is \"1\"."}

The string is \"write0ignore1ignore0ignore0read\".\n2. We need to find the last occurrence of the substring \"write\" in the string.\n3. The last index of \"write\" in the string is 6.\n4. In a string, the digit after the last occurrence of a substring is obtained by taking the character at the index + 1.\n5. The character at index 6 is \"0\".\n6.

The string is \"write1read1ignore1ignore0read\".\n2. The \"write\" instructions tell us to replace a digit with a \"w\".\n3. The \"read\" instructions tell us to replace a character with the corresponding digit.\n4. The last \"read\" instruction is \"read0\".\n5. The character before the \"read0\" instruction is \"g\", so we replace \"g0\" with \"0\".\n6. The final string is \"w1w1ignore1ignore0w\".\n7.

The last \"write\" instruction consists of two \"0\" characters.\n4. We need to extract the digit after the second \"0\". In this case, the second \"0\" is in the position 10, and the digit after it is \"0\".\n5. Therefore, the output is \"0\"."}

The string is \"write0ignore0ignore0ignore0read\".\n2. We need to find the last occurrence of the substring \"write\".\n3. The last occurrence of \"write\" is in the 6th position (counting from 0).\n4. The last character in the string after the \"write\" is \"r\".\n5. So, the answer is \"r\" in the 7th position, which is the last digit.\n6. Converting the character \"r\" to its numerical value (18 in ASCII), we get the final answer as \"8\" (the last digit of 18 is \"8\").\n7. However, since we are looking for the last digit after the last \"write\" instruction, we can ignore the ASCII value and just return the character \"8\" as the final answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is <answer>8</answer>."}
