The last occurrence of \"write\" is in the 6th position (counting from 0).\n4. The last character in the string after the \"write\" is \"r\".\n5. So, the answer is \"r\" in the 7th position, which is the last digit.\n6. Converting the character \"r\" to its numerical value (18 in ASCII), we get the final answer as \"8\" (the last digit of 18 is \"8\").\n7. However, since we are looking for the last digit after the last \"write\" instruction, we can ignore the ASCII value and just return the character \"8\" as the answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is <answer>8</answer>."}
