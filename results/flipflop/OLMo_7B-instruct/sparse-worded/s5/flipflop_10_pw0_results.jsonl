The string is \"write0read0ignore1ignore0read\".\n2. We need to find the last occurrence of the word \"write\".\n3. The last \"write\" in the string is at the position \"write0write0\".\n4. The position of the last \"write\" is calculated as: \"write\" appears at positions 0, 8, and 20. The last occurrence of \"write\" is at position 20.\n5. To get the digit after the last \"write\", we need to look at the character at the next position (position 21).\n6. The character at position 21 is \"r\".\n7. The digit after the last \"write\" is \"0\".\n\nTherefore, the output is <answer>0</answer>."}

The string is \"write0ignore0ignore0ignore0read\".\n2. We need to find the last occurrence of the substring \"write\".\n3. The last occurrence of \"write\" is in the 6th position (counting from 0).\n4. The last character in the string after the \"write\" is \"r\".\n5. So, the answer is \"r\" in the 7th position, which is the last digit.\n6. Converting the character \"r\" to its numerical value (18 in ASCII), we get the final answer as \"8\" (the last digit of 18 is \"8\").\n7. However, since we are looking for the last digit after the last \"write\" instruction, we can ignore the ASCII value and just return the character \"8\" as the answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is <answer>8</answer>."}

The string is \"write1read1ignore0ignore1read\".\n2. The \"write\" instructions tell us to replace a character with another character. In this case, \"write1\" replaces \"1\" with \"w\", \"write0\" replaces \"0\" with \"w\", and \"write1\" replaces \"1\" with \"w\" again.\n3. After following the \"write\" instructions, the string becomes \"wread1ignorewignore1read\".\n4. The \"read\" instructions tell us to replace a character with the next character in the string. In this case, \"read1\" replaces \"1\" with \"w\", \"read\" replaces the next character with the next character in the string, and \"read1\" replaces \"1\" with \"w\" again.\n5. After following the \"read\" instructions, the string becomes \"wwread1ignorewignore1read\".\n6. The last \"read\" instruction replaces the next character with the next character in the string, which is \"r\".\n7. Therefore, the last digit in the string is \"1\".\n8. The answer is \"1\"."}
