Therefore, the output is '0'.\n\nHere's the relevant part of the input string with the characters to the right of the 21st position highlighted:\n\nw1i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0w1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i0r1i1w0i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i0r <-- Input string\ni1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i0r                                                   <-- Characters to the right of the 21st position\n\nSo, the output is <answer>0</answer>."}
