Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n2. Get the substring from the index of the last 'w' character + 1 (skip the 'w' character) to the end of the string.\n3. Extract the last digit from the substring.\n\nHere's the code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef get_last_digit(input_string):\n    last_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n    last_digit_substring = input_string[last_w_index + 1:]\n    last_digit = last_digit_substring[-1]\n    return last_digit\n\ninput_string = \"w0i0i0r0i0i1w0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1w1i0r1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r1w1i0i1i1i0i1w1r1w0i0r0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0r\"\nprint(get_"}
