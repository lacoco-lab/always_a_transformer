Return the digit from this integer.\n\nThe last 'w' character's index is 20, and the characters after it are 'r'. Converting 'r' to integer gives 18, and the digit in the ones place is 8 (since 18 / 10 = 1 with remainder 8). Therefore, the digit after the last 'w' character is 8.\n\nHowever, the given input string has no 'w' character after the last 'w' character, so the last character after the last 'w' character is 'r'. The digit in the ones place of 'r' is '8'. Therefore, the output digit is '8'."}
