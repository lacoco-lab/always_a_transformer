The last \"w\" character is in the position with index 23. The digit after the last \"w\" character is \"i\". To get the digit after the last \"w\", we need to extract the character to the right of the \"w\". The character to the right of the \"w\" in the 23rd position is \"r\". To get the digit after the \"r\", we need to extract the last digit of the character. The character \"r\" has the digits \"3\" and \"4\". The last digit of \"4\" is \"4\". So, the digit after the last \"w\" character is \"4\".\n\n<answer>4</answer>"}

The last 'w' character in both substrings is at the index 23 and the index 29 respectively.\n\nTo get the digit after the last 'w' character, we need to extract the characters after the 'w' in both substrings. In the first substring, the characters after the 'w' are 'i1i0', and in the second substring, the characters after the 'w' are 'i1i1'.\n\nNow, we need to convert these characters to their respective digits. The character 'i' represents the digit '5', and we need to convert '0' and '1' to their respective digits as well.\n\nFor the first substring, the digit after the last 'w' is '50'.\n\nFor the second substring, the digit after the last 'w' is '51'.\n\nSo, the output is <answer>5</answer> and <answer>5</answer> for the first and second occurrences of the substring \"w"}
