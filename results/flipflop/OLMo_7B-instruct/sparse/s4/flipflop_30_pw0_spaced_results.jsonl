Therefore, there is no digit after it. I have checked the string carefully and found that the last occurrence of 'w' is in the substring 'w1wi0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r'. However, the digit after the 'w' character is '0', which is not the answer. Since there is no last 'w' character in the string, the answer is '0' as there is no digit after it."}

The last character of the string is 'r', which is not an 'w'. Therefore, the last 'w' character is the one before 'r', which is the 6th character from the right end.
