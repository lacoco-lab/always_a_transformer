Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n   Index of the last 'w' character is: 28\n\n2. Get the character at the index + 1 (since indices in Python are zero-based, and the character at index + 1 would be after the 'w' character).\n   Character at index + 1 is: 'i'\n\n3. Extract the digit from the character.\n   Digit in the character is: 1\n\n4. Return the digit as the answer.\n   Answer: <answer>1</answer> would not be correct, since there is only one 'w' in the string, and the last 'w' is at index 28. The character at index + 1 is 'i', and the digit in 'i' is '1'. Therefore, the answer is '0'."}
