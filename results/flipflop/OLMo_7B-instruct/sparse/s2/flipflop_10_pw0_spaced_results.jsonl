Return the digit from the integer.\n\nThe last 'w' index is at position 7, and the characters from that index to the end of the string are 'i1r'. Converting 'i1r' to integer gives us '121', and the digit after the last 'w' is '1'."}

To get the digit after this 'w', we need to extract the seventh character from the right. In this case, the seventh character is 'r'. So, the digit after the last 'w' is 'r' extracted as 'r'[6] = 'r'[7] = '0'. Therefore, the output is '0'."}
