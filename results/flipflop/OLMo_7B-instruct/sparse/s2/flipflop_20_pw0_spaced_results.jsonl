The last character before it is '0', and the character after the 'w' is also '0'. To get the digit, we need to extract the '0' character. \n\nTo extract the character, we can use string indexing. The index of the 'w' character is 4, and the index of the character before it is 3. We can extract the character at index 3 using the following code:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i1i0i1w0i1r0i0i1r\"\nlast_w_index = input_string.index(\"w\") - 1\ndigit = input_string[last_w_index]\nprint(digit)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n0\n```\n\nTherefore, the digit after the last 'w' character in the input string is '0'."}

To find the digit after this 'w' character, we need to look at the sixth character from the right side of the string. In this case, the sixth character from the right side is 'r'. So, the digit after the last 'w' character is 'r' converted to a digit which is '8' (as 'r' is the 8th letter of the alphabet). But, we need to find the digit after the 'w' character from the end of the string. In this case, there is no 'w' character after the fifth 'w' character, so we look at the next character after the fifth 'w' character. The next character after the fifth 'w' character is 'i', and the digit after 'i' is '0'. Therefore, the output is '0'."}
