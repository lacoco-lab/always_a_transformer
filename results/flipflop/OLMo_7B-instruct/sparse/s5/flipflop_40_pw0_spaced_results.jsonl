Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n2. Get the characters from the last 'w' index to the end of the string.\n3. Convert the characters to an integer.\n4. Return the digit from the integer.\n\nThe last 'w' index is at position 22. The characters from the last 'w' index to the end of the string are 'r0i0r0i0'. Converting this to an integer gives us '1280'. The digit after the last 'w' is '2', which is the fourth digit from the right (counting from the end) in the integer '1280'.\n\nTherefore, the output is '2' (as a character). Converting '2' to a decimal number gives us '2'. Since we need to return the digit after the last 'w', the output is '0'."}

The digit after the last 'w' character is the second digit, which is '1'. Therefore, the output is '1'. However, since we need the digit after the last 'w' character, the output is '0', as there is no digit after the second 'w' character in the given string."}
