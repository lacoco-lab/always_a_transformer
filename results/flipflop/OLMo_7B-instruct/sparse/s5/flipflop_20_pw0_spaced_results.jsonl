The last 'w' character is the one before it, which is the third character from the beginning. The third character's position is calculated by using the formula: length of string - character position - 1. In this case, the length of the string is 13, and the character position of the 'w' is 3. So, the formula becomes: 13 - 3 - 1 = 8. The eighth character from the beginning is '0'. Therefore, the digit after the last 'w' character is '0'."}
