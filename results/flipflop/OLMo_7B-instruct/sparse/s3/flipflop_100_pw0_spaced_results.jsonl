To find the digit after the last 'w', we need to extract the character at the next index (35 + 1 = 36), which is 'r'. The digit after the last 'w' is '0'. However, the digit after the 'r' character is not a digit, so we only consider the digit before the 'r' character, which is '0'. Therefore, the output is <answer>0</answer>."}
