Return the digit from the integer.\n\nThe last 'w' index is at position 21. The characters from the last 'w' index to the end of the string are 'i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0'. Converting these characters to an integer gives us 1090. The digit after the last 'w' is 0. Therefore, the output is <answer>0</answer>."}

{"id": 95, "prompt": "w1i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i0i1i1r", "answer": 0, "flipflop": "w1i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1", "last_valid_token": 1, "last_write_index": 14, "full_answer": "<answer>0</answer>\n\nExplanation: The given string contains one 'w' character before the last 'w' character, which is at position 22. To find the digit after the last 'w', we need to extract the character at position 23. The character at position 23 is 'r'. To get the digit after 'w', we need to extract the digit from this character. The digit is '1'. So, the output is <answer>1</answer>. However, the given character at position 23 is not a single digit. Therefore, we extract the rightmost digit from the character 'r', which is '0'. So, the final answer is <answer>0</answer>."}

The digit after this 'w' character is '0'. Therefore, the output is '0'."}
{"id": 97, "prompt": "w1i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1w1i0i1r", "answer": 0, "flipflop": "w1i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1w1i0i1r1", "last_valid_token": 1, "last_write_index": 22, "full_answer": "<answer>0</answer>\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n2. Get the characters from the index of the last 'w' character to the end of the string.\n3. Convert the characters to an integer.\n4. Return the integer as a digit.\n\nThe last 'w' character's index is 20, and the characters from the index of the last 'w' character to the end of the string are 'i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1'. Converting these characters to an integer gives us 11111111, and the last digit of 11111111 is 1. However, the input string does not contain any '1' after the '1' at the end, so the correct answer is '0'."}
{"id": 98, "prompt": "w1i0i1w1r1i1i0r1i1i0i1w0i1i1r", "answer": 0, "flipflop": "w1i0i1w1r1i1i0r1i1i0i1w0i1i1r0", "last_valid_token": 0, "last_write_index": 22, "full_answer": "<answer>0</answer>\n\nExplanation: In the given input string, there is only one 'w' character which is the sixth character from the beginning of the string. The last character of the string is 'r', which is not an 'w' character. Therefore, the last 'w' character in the string is the sixth character from the beginning. The sixth character from the beginning is the 'i' character. To extract the digit after the 'i' character, we can extract the seventh character from the beginning of the string, which is '0'. So, the digit after the last 'w' character is '0'."}
