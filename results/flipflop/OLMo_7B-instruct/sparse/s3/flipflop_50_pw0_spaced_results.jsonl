Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n2. Get the characters from the last 'w' character to the end of the string.\n3. Convert the characters to an integer.\n4. Return the digit from the integer.\n\nThe last 'w' character's index is 20, and the characters after it are 'i1i1i1'. Converting 'i1i1i1' to integer gives us '111', and the digit after the last 'w' is '1'. Therefore, the output is '1'. However, the given string also contains another 'w' character at the beginning, so the last 'w' character in the string is at index 20. The characters after the last 'w' character are 'i1i1i1'. Converting 'i1i1i1' to integer gives us '111', and the digit after the last 'w' is '1'. Therefore, the output is '1'."}
