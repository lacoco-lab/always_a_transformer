Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n2. Get the characters from the last 'w' character to the end of the string.\n3. Convert these characters to an integer.\n4. Return the digit at the ones place value (last digit).\n\nThe last 'w' character's index is 26 (since there are 26 letters in the alphabet). The characters after the last 'w' are '0i0i0r'. Converting these characters to integers and then converting them to a string, we get '0'. The digit at the ones place value (last digit) is '0'. Therefore, the output is '0'."}
