Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Move one position to the right from that 'w' to find the digit.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"w1r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i0i0r0w1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1w0r0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i1r\"\n\n# Find the index of the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# If 'w' is not found, return None\nif rightmost_w_index == -1:\n    print(\"w not found\")\nelse:\n    # Move one position to the right of 'w' to find the digit\n    digit_after_w = input_string[rightmost_w_index + 1]\n    \n    # Print the digit\n    print(digit_after_w)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Based on the provided options:\n\nA. 0\nB. 1\n\nThe output from the code will directly correspond to one of these options. Let's execute the code to determine the exact answer:\n\n```python\n# Execute the code\nrightmost_w_index = \"w1r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i0i0r0w1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1w0r0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i1r\".rfind('w')\ndigit_after_w = \"w1r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i0i0r0w1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1w0r0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i1r\".__getitem__(rightmost_w_index + 1)\n\nprint(digit_after_w)\n```\n\nThe output of the above code will be:\n\n```plaintext\n0\n```\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is:\n\n<answer> A </answer>"}
