Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Move one position to the right from that 'w' to find the digit.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"w0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0w0i1r0i0i1i1i1r0r0i0w0i0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1i0i0w1r1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i1r1i0w0i1i1r0i0i0w0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0r0w1w1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0w1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i1w0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1w0i1r0r0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1i1w0i1w0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i0i1w1i0i0r1i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0w0i1i1w0r0i0r0i0r0i0i1i0i1i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1r0w0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0r0i0r0i0i1i1i1r\"\n\n# Find the index of the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Move one position to the right to find the digit\ndigit_after_w = input_string[rightmost_w_index + 1]\n\n# Check if the character is a digit (0-9)\nif digit_after_w.isdigit():\n    answer = digit_after_w\nelse:\n    answer = None\n\n# Since the problem asks for the digit after 'w', and we are given options A and B,\n# we assume the answer should be one of these two digits directly.\n# If the character is '0' or '1', we map it to the corresponding option.\nif digit_after_w == '0':\n    result = 'A'\nelif digit_after_w == '1':\n    result = 'B'\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the answer directly. However, since the string is quite long, let's simplify the approach by directly inspecting the string:\n\nFrom the given string:\n```\nw0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0w0i1r0i0i1i1i1r0r0i0w0i0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1i0i0w1r1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i1r1i0w0i1i1r0i0i0w0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0r0w1w1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0w1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i1w0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1w0i1r0r0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1i1w0i1w0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i0i1w1i0i0r1i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0w0i1i1w0r0i0r0i0r0i0i1i0i1i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1r0w0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0r0i0r0i0i1i1i1r\n```\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is followed by '0'. \n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nThe answer is:\n<answer> A </answer>"}
