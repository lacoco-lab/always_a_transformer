Determine the digit of the character found in step 2.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"w0i1i1i1i1i0r0i0r0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1w0w0i1i0i0r0i0i0w1r1i0i1r1w0i1i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i1i1r0i0i0w0i0i0i0r0i0r0i1i1i1i1i0i0w0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0w0r0i0r0i0i0r\"\n\n# Find the index of the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Ensure the rightmost 'w' is found\nif rightmost_w_index == -1:\n    print(\"Error: No 'w' found in the string.\")\nelse:\n    # Move one position to the right of the rightmost 'w'\n    next_char_index = rightmost_w_index + 1\n    \n    # Check if the next character is a digit and determine its value\n    if input_string[next_char_index].isdigit():\n        digit = int(input_string[next_char_index])\n        # Since we are asked for the digit, not the character, we output the digit directly\n        print(digit)\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Character after 'w' is not a digit.\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the digit after the rightmost 'w'.
