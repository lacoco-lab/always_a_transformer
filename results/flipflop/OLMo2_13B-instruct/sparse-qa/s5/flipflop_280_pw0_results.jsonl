Return the digit.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_w(input_str):\n    # Find the index of the rightmost 'w'\n    rightmost_w_index = input_str.rfind('w')\n    \n    # Ensure 'w' is found\n    if rightmost_w_index == -1:\n        return None  # In case 'w' is not present\n\n    # Move one position to the right of 'w' and get the digit\n    digit_after_w = input_str[rightmost_w_index + 1]\n    \n    return digit_after_w\n\n# Given input string\ninput_str = \"w1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i1i1r1i0i1w1i1i1i1i1r1r1i1i1i1w0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0i1w1w1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r1r1i1i1i1i1i1i1w1i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i1i0i1i1r1i0r1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i0w0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i0w0i1i0w0i1w0i0r0i0w0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i1r\"\n\n# Get the digit after the rightmost 'w'\ndigit = find_digit_after_w(input_str)\nprint(digit)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the digit after the rightmost 'w' in the provided string. Based on the implementation, the output will be:\n\n```plaintext\n<answer>B</answer>"}
