Move one character to the right from that position to find the digit.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i1i0w0r0w1i0i0i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i1r1i1r1i1i1r1i0i1i1r1i0w0i0i1i1r0i1w0i0i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i0r0i1i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i0r0r0i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1r1i1i1w0w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i1w0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i1w0i0i0w0r0w0i1r0i1i1i0r0i0i1i1r0i1i1r0r\"\n\n# Find the index of the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Move one character to the right to find the digit\ndigit_after_w = input_string[rightmost_w_index + 1]\n\n# Check if the character is a digit (0-9)\nif digit_after_w.isdigit():\n    answer = 'A' if int(digit_after_w) == 0 else 'B'\nelse:\n    answer = ''\n\nprint(<answer>{}< /answer>)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the digit after the rightmost 'w' and determine whether it's 0 or 1. The output will be wrapped in `<answer>` and `</answer>"}
