Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Move one position to the right from that 'w' to find the next character.\n3. Determine the digit of the character found in step 2.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w1i0i0r1i0r1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1w0i1i1r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0w0i0r0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i1w1i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0w1i1r1r1w0i1i1i1i1r0i1i0r0i1w1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1w1i0i0w1i1i0w1i1i0i0w1i1i0i1i0w1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i1w1i1i0w1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i0r\"\n\n# Find the index of the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Move one position to the right of the rightmost 'w'\nnext_char_index = rightmost_w_index + 1\n\n# Get the character at the next_char_index and determine if it's a digit\nnext_char = input_string[next_char_index]\nis_digit = next_char.isdigit()\n\n# If it's a digit, determine the value\nif is_digit:\n    digit_value = int(next_char)\n    # Since the options are A (0) or B (1), we directly return the digit value\n    answer = str(digit_value)\nelse:\n    answer = \"B\"  # If not a digit, assume the next character is '1' as per the options\n\nprint(<answer>{}<answer>)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the answer based on the logic implemented. Given the options and the typical structure of the string, the next character after 'w' is likely to be '0' or '1'. The code will confirm this by checking if the character is a digit and then returning either '0' or '1'.\n\nGiven the string structure and the options provided, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is **0**. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
