Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' in the given string.\n2. Determine the digit immediately after this 'w'.\n\nHere's the step-by-step algorithm:\n\n1. **Find the index of the rightmost 'w' in the string.**\n   - Iterate through the string from the end towards the beginning.\n   - Check each character to see if it is 'w'.\n   - Keep track of the index when 'w' is found.\n\n2. **Get the digit immediately after the 'w'.**\n   - Once the rightmost 'w' is found, get the character immediately to its right.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"w0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0w0i1r0i0i1r0i0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0r0r\"\n\n# Find the index of the rightmost 'w'\nrightmost_w_index = input_string.rfind('w')\n\n# Ensure the index is valid and not -1 (indicating 'w' not found)\nif rightmost_w_index != -1:\n    # Get the digit after the rightmost 'w'\n    digit_after_w = input_string[rightmost_w_index + 1]\n    \n    # Print the answer\n    print(\"<answer>A</answer>"}
