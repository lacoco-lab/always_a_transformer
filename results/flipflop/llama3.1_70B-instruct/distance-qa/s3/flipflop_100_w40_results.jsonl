The string is: \"...r0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1r0i1r0i1i0r0i0r\" and the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string: \"...r0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1r0i1r0i1i0r0i0r**w**0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0i0r0i0i1r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1r0i1r0i1i0r0i0r\".\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
