This 'w' is at the position marked below (for clarity, I'll use a caret symbol '^' to mark the position of the rightmost 'w', though it's not part of the string):\n\n   ...i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r\n\n   The rightmost 'w' is actually a bit to the left of this, let's correct that:\n\n   ...i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i0r1w1r1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0r1i1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r\n\n   So, the rightmost 'w' is here: ...i0r1w1...\n\n3. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Finding the rightmost 'w':\n   - Start from the end of the string and move left until we find a 'w'.\n   - The rightmost 'w' is found at the position marked below (for clarity, the string is truncated to show the relevant part):\n     ...i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1i0r1r1r\n\n2. Checking the character to the right of the rightmost 'w':\n   - The character immediately to the right of the 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
