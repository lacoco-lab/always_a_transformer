Given the string starts with 'w' and there's no 'w' elsewhere, the premise might seem flawed. Yet, following the algorithmic approach strictly as described, we don't find another 'w' to analyze in the conventional sense. The question seems to be based on a misunderstanding or a trick, as the rightmost 'w' is at the start, and the digit immediately after it is indeed '1', but this doesn't fit the expected analysis of finding a 'w' within the string followed by a digit.\n\nGiven the strict interpretation and the provided options, and acknowledging the confusion in the task's setup:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Since 'w' is the first character and there's no digit immediately after it within the string (as it's the start), the premise of the question seems to be based on an assumption that there is a digit following 'w' within the string, which is not the case here.\n\nHowever, following the instructions to the letter as requested and considering the spirit of the task might imply looking for a digit immediately after the first occurrence of 'w' (even though it's the start of the string), we would technically be looking at the first character after 'w', which is '1'. But since the task specifically asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w' and given the structure of the question, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the task's description or in interpreting the task's requirements based on the provided string.\n\nGiven the string starts with 'w' and there's no 'w' elsewhere, the task's premise seems flawed or based on a different expected string structure. However, if we were to choose based on the immediate character after 'w' in a general sense (ignoring the rightmost aspect due to 'w' being at the start), the character immediately after 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Since 'w' is the first character and there's no character to its right within the string, the premise of the question seems to be based on an assumption that there is a digit immediately following 'w'. Given the string starts with 'w' and is immediately followed by '1', we can infer the question intends to ask about the digit following 'w' in a scenario where 'w' is not the last character or in a misunderstanding of the string's structure.\n\nHowever, strictly following the instructions and the string provided, since 'w' is the first character and there's no character to its right that we can consider in this context (as the question seems to imply a search within the string for a 'w' that is not at the start), the question's premise appears flawed given the provided string starts with 'w'. \n\nBut, if we consider the spirit of the question might be asking for the digit immediately following the 'w' in a general sense (and acknowledging the confusion), the digit immediately after 'w' in the given string is '1', which corresponds to option B.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Check the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n\nHere's how we can do it algorithmically:\n\n- Start from the end of the string and scan backwards.\n- The first 'w' we encounter will be the rightmost 'w'.\n- Once we find the rightmost 'w', we check the character immediately to its right.\n\nGiven the string: w0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0i0i0r0i1i1r0r0i1i0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i0r0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0r0i1r0r0i0i1r0i1r0r0r\n\nStarting from the end and scanning backwards, the first 'w' we encounter is at the very beginning of the string. Therefore, there is no character to the right of 'w' in the context of the entire string, as 'w' is the first character. However, following the instructions strictly and considering the task might imply looking for a digit immediately after 'w' within the string's context, we must note the task's specifics:\n\nGiven the string starts with 'w', and the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', we should clarify that in a strict sense, there's no digit immediately after 'w' since 'w' is the first character. However, if we interpret the task as looking for the first digit after 'w' within the string's sequence, we'd look at the character immediately following 'w', which is '0'.\n\nTherefore, based on the task's possible interpretation and the provided options, the answer would be:\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
