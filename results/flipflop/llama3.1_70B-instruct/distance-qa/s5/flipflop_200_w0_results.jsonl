The 'w' is at the start of the string.\n\n2. **Check the character to the right of 'w'**: The character immediately to the right of 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' character in the string.\n2. Check the character immediately to the right of the 'w' found in step 1.\n\nHere's how we can do it algorithmically:\n\nInput string: w0r0i1i1i1r0i1r0i0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i1r0i1i1r0i1r0i1i1r0r0i1i0i0r0r0i0i0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0i0i0r0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0r0r0i0i0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0r0r0i1i0i1r0r0i0r0i0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r\n\n1. **Find the rightmost 'w' character**: Starting from the end of the string, we look for the first occurrence of 'w'. Since there's only one 'w' in the string and it's at the beginning, we don't have to look far. The 'w' is at the start of the string.\n\n2. **Check the character immediately to the right of 'w'**: The character right after 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
