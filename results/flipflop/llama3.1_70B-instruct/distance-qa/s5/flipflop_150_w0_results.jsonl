If we were to consider a scenario where 'w' is within the string and not at the start, we'd look for the digit immediately following it.

Check the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n\nHere's how we can do it algorithmically:\n\n- Start from the end of the string and scan backwards.\n- The first 'w' we encounter will be the rightmost 'w'.\n- Once we find the rightmost 'w', we check the character immediately to its right.\n\nGiven the string: w0r0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0r0i0i1r0i0r0r0r0i0i0i1i0i0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1i1i0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i1i1i0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i0r\n\nStarting from the end and scanning backwards, the first 'w' we encounter is at the very beginning of the string. Therefore, there is no character to the right of 'w' that is not part of the string itself, but since the question asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', we look at the character immediately following 'w', which is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once the rightmost 'w' is found, look at the character immediately to its right.\n\nHere's how we can do it algorithmically:\n\n- Start from the end of the string and move towards the beginning.\n- The first 'w' we encounter will be the rightmost 'w'.\n- Check the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the string: w1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1r1i1i0r1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0i0i0r1i0r1r1i1r1i0r1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r\n\nStarting from the end and moving towards the beginning, the first 'w' we encounter is at the very beginning of the string. Therefore, there is no character to the right of 'w' within the string, as 'w' is the first character. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', implying we are looking for a digit that immediately follows 'w' within the string's bounds. Since 'w' is the first character and there's no digit immediately after it within the string (as it's the start), the premise of the question seems to be based on an assumption that there is a digit immediately following 'w' within the string, which is not the case here.\n\nHowever, following the instructions to the letter as requested and considering the spirit of the task might imply looking for the first digit after 'w' in a scenario where 'w' is not the last character or considering the immediate context provided:\n\nGiven the string starts with 'w' and is immediately followed by '1', if we were to interpret the task as looking for the digit immediately after 'w' in a general sense (even though 'w' is at the start), the answer would be based on the first character after 'w', which is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
