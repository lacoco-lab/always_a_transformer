Therefore, there is no character to the right of 'w' within the string, as 'w' is the first character. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', and since 'w' is at the start, the next character is '1', which is a digit.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Given the string starts with 'w' and is immediately followed by '1', if we were to consider the first character after 'w' (which is not the case here as 'w' is at the start), the digit would be '1'.
