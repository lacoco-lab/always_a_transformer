Starting from the end of the string, we look for the first occurrence of 'w'. Since there's only one 'w' in the string and it's at the beginning, we don't have to search far. The rightmost 'w' is the first character.\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
