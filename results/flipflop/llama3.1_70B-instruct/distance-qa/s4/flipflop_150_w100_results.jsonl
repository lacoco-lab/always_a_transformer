The string is: w0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i0r0i0r0i0i1r0i1r0i0i1r0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0i0r0i0i0r0r0r0r0i0r0w1i0i1r1i1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1r1i0i1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0r1i1r\n\n2. The rightmost 'w' is the second 'w' from the left, which is at the end of the string before the last set of characters: ...r0r0w1i0i1r1i1i0r1r1i0i0r1i1r1i0i1r1r1i1i0r1r1i0r1i1r\n\n3. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Check the character immediately after this 'w'.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given string:\n\nInput: w1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1i1r1i0i0i1i1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i1i1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1r1w0i0i0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0r0i0i1i0i0r0r\n\nStarting from the end and moving towards the beginning, the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'. The character immediately after this 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is 0.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
