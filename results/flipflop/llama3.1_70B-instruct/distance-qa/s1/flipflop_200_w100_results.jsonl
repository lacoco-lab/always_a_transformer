Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Check the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n\nHere's how we can do it algorithmically:\n\nInput string: w1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1i0i0i1i1r1i1i0r1i1i1i1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0i1w1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i1r1i0i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0r1r1i1i1i0r1r\n\n1. **Find the rightmost 'w'**: Starting from the end of the string, we look for the first occurrence of 'w'. The string ends with \"...r1r1i1i1i0r1r\", so we move backwards until we find the 'w'. The rightmost 'w' is in the sequence \"...i0i1w1i0i0...\".\n\n2. **Check the character immediately to the right of 'w'**: The character right after 'w1' is 'i', but we are looking for a digit. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', and the sequence is \"...i0i1w1i0i0...\". The digit immediately after 'w' in this context is '1', but since 'w' is followed by '1i', the digit right after 'w' in the sequence given is indeed '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
