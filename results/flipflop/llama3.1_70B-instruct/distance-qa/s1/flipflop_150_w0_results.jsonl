Starting from the end of the string, we find the first occurrence of 'w', which is the rightmost 'w'. In this case, it's the very first character of the string.\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
