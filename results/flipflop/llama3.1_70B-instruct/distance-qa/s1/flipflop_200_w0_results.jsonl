Check the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n\nHere's how we can do it algorithmically:\n\n- Start from the end of the string and move towards the beginning.\n- The first 'w' we encounter will be the rightmost 'w'.\n- Once we find the rightmost 'w', we check the next character.\n\nGiven the string: w1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i1i0i1r1r1i1i0i1i0r1i0i0r1i0r1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i0r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i0r1i0i0i1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0i1r1i1r1i0i1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1r1r1i1r\n\nStarting from the end, the first 'w' we encounter is at the very beginning of the string. Therefore, there is no character to the right of 'w' that is not part of the string itself, but since 'w' is at the start, the character immediately after 'w' is '1'.\n\nHowever, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', and since 'w' is at the start, the digit immediately after it is '1', which corresponds to option B.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
