Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Check the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nHere is the algorithm in action:\n\nInput string: w0i1r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0i0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i1w1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r\n\n1. Finding the rightmost 'w':\n   - Start from the end of the string and move left until we find a 'w'.\n   - The rightmost 'w' is the second 'w' from the left in the string: ...i1w1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r\n\n2. Checking the character to the right of the rightmost 'w':\n   - The character immediately to the right of 'w1' is 'r'.\n\nHowever, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', and 'r' is not a digit. Let's correct the approach by looking at the actual digits provided in the options and re-evaluating the string correctly:\n\nGiven the corrected understanding that we are looking for a digit (0 or 1) immediately after the rightmost 'w', let's re-examine the string:\n\n...i1w1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is followed by '1', which is indeed a digit and matches one of the provided options.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
