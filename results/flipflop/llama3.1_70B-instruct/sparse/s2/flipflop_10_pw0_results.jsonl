Starting from the end of the string, I find the first 'w' which is the rightmost 'w'. The string with the rightmost 'w' marked is: w1i1w1i0r -> ...w1i0r, so the rightmost 'w' is the one before '1i0r'.\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
