Check the character immediately to the right of the last 'w': Since the last 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no character to the right of it. However, I will look at the character before the last 'w' (since we want the rightmost 'w') and then check the character after that 'w'. The last 'w' is the third 'w' from the left. The character after the third 'w' from the left is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
