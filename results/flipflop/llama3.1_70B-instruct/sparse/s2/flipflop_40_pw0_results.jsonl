Checking the character to the right of the rightmost 'w':\n   - The original string with the rightmost 'w' identified is: ...i1i1i1i0i0i0r1i1i0i1i1r (focus on the last 'w' and what comes after it)\n   - The character immediately to the right of the last 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
