Find the last occurrence of 'w': The last 'w' is at the end of the string, but since we are looking for the character after it, we consider the 'w' before the last one, which is the second last 'w'. However, since we are looking for the character after the rightmost 'w', we actually consider the last 'w' and look for the character after it, but in this case, there is no character after the last 'w'. So, we look at the last 'w' and see that it is followed by a '0'.\n\n2. Check the character immediately to the right of the last 'w': The character is '0'.\n\n3. Print the digit: <answer>0</answer>"}
