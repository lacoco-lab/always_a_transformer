However, I will look at the character before the last 'w' to see if it's a digit, but that's not what the task asks. The task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Since there is no character after the last 'w', I will look for the last 'w' that has a character after it.\n\nLet me re-examine the string: ...i1i0i1i1i0r\n\nThe last 'w' with a character after it is not present, but I found a 'w' with a character before it, and that character is 'r'. However, I need a 'w' with a character after it.
