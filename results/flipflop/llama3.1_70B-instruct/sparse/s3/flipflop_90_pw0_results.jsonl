Find the rightmost 'w' character:\n   Starting from the end of the string and moving left, the first 'w' encountered is the rightmost 'w'. The rightmost 'w' is at position 43 (counting from 0).\n\n2. Check the character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w':\n   The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
