Find the rightmost 'w': The rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string, which is at position 73 (0-indexed).\n\n2. Check the character to the right of the rightmost 'w': The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n3. Print the digit: Since the character is a digit (1), I will print it.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
