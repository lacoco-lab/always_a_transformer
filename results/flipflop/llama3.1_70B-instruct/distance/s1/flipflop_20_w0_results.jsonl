The task seems to imply looking for a digit that follows 'w' in a sequence where 'w' is not at the start. Given the string and the task's wording, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation. Following the task literally as it's written, there's no digit \"after\" the 'w' in the direction the string is read (left to right), since 'w' is the first character. \n\nHowever, if we interpret the task as looking for the digit that comes after 'w' in a sequence where 'w' is part of a larger pattern and not necessarily at the start, we would look for the first digit after 'w' in the reading direction. In this case, the first digit after 'w' is indeed '1'.\n\nGiven the confusion and to adhere strictly to the format requested for the answer, and considering the most straightforward interpretation where 'w' is at the start and we look for the next digit in the sequence:\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
