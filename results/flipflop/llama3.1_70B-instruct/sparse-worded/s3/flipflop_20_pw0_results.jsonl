Return the digit immediately after the last 'write' instruction:\n   - The digit immediately after 'write0' is not available as it is the last 'write' instruction, but we can see that the next instruction is 'ignore1'. However, the task asks for the digit after the 'write' instruction, not the instruction itself. Therefore, the digit after 'write0' is indeed '0', but since '0' is part of the 'write0' instruction, we look at the next instruction which is 'ignore1'. The digit we are looking for is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

Find the last occurrence of 'write': The last 'write' is at the beginning of the string, but since we are looking for the last occurrence, we consider the entire string and find that there is only one 'write' which is at the start. However, since the task asks for the digit after the last 'write', we proceed with extracting the digit after it.\n\n2. Extract the digit after the last 'write': The digit immediately after 'write' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the last 'write' instruction is:\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
