Find the last occurrence of 'write': The last 'write' is at index 0 (the first 'write') and there are no more 'write' instructions after it, but there is another 'write' at index 13. So, the last 'write' is at index 13.\n2. Get the index of the last 'write': The index of the last 'write' is 13.\n3. Return the character immediately after the last 'write': The character immediately after the last 'write' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
