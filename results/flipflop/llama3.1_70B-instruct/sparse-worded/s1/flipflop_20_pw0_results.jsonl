Return the digit immediately after the last 'write' instruction:\n   - The digit after 'write0' is not available as it is the last 'write' instruction, but we can see that there is no digit after 'write0' in the given input string. However, the task asks for the digit after the last 'write' instruction. Since 'write0' is followed by 'read', we can conclude that there is no digit after the last 'write' instruction in the given input string. But if we consider the digit in 'write0' as the last 'write' instruction's digit, then the digit is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
