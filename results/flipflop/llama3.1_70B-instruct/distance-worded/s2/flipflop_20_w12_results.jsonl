Return the digit immediately after the last 'write' instruction:\n   - The digit immediately after 'write0' is not available as it is the last 'write' instruction, but we can see that the next instruction is 'ignore1'. However, the task asks for the digit after the 'write' instruction, not the instruction itself. Therefore, we look at the digit that comes immediately after 'write0' in the original string, which is not present as it is the last 'write' instruction. But if we look at the original string, we can see that the digit after 'write0' is actually the digit '0' is part of the 'write0' instruction itself,"}
