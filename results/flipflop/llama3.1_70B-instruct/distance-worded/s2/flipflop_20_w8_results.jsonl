Find the last occurrence of 'write':\n   - The last 'write' starts at index 24 (0-based indexing).\n\n2. Extract the character immediately after the last 'write':\n   - The character after 'write' at index 24 is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the last 'write' instruction is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
