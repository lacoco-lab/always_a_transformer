Return the digit immediately after the last 'write' instruction:\n   - The digit immediately after 'write0' is the digit in the next instruction, which is 'read'. However, 'read' does not have a digit immediately after it in the instruction sequence. Instead, we look at the digit in 'read', which is not present. We need to look at the instruction 'write0' itself, and the digit after 'write' in 'write0' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
