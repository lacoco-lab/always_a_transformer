However, since this 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no character to its right. But, since the task is to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', and given the 'w' is at the end, we must look at the context of the question again. The question asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', but in this case, there is no digit after the last 'w' because it is the last character in the string.\n\nHowever, given the options and the context, it seems we are expected to find a digit that follows a 'w' in the string, even if it's not the very last character. In that case, we look for the second to last 'w' and check the digit after it.\n\nUpon reviewing the string again for the second to last 'w', we find it is \"...i0w0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i0w1...\".

Starting from the end of the string, we find the first 'w' which is the rightmost 'w'. This 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0i0w1r.\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
