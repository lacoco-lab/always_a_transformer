The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' does not exist since the 'w' is at the end of the string. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Given the options and the context, it seems we are to consider the last 'w' in the string and then look at the digit that would follow it if we were to add or consider a digit after it based on the pattern or the given options. However, strictly following the instruction without assuming additional context or digits not provided, the task as stated does not directly apply since there is no digit after the last 'w'. \n\nGiven the constraints and the format requested for the answer, and considering the task might imply looking for a pattern or an assumption not directly stated, I will proceed under the assumption that we are to consider the pattern of digits that follow 'w's in the string or acknowledge the oversight in the task's description. However, based strictly on the task's description and the provided string, there is no digit after the rightmost 'w'.\n\nSince I must choose between the provided options and given the nature of the task might imply an error or omission in the description regarding the handling of the last 'w', I will select an answer based on the pattern observed in the string, though it does not directly apply to the last 'w':\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
