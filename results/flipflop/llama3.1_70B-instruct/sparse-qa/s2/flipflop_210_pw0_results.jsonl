Given the options and the structure of the task, it seems there might have been an expectation for a digit to follow the last 'w', which is not the case here.\n\nGiven the constraints and the misunderstanding, I will not select an answer from the provided options as the scenario described does not match the string's actual content.

The character immediately to the right of this 'w' does not exist since 'w' is at the end of the string. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Given the string ends with 'w', there is no digit after it. But since we have to choose from the given options and there's no digit after the last 'w', we should consider the context of the question. The question seems to imply there should be a digit after 'w' based on the options provided, but according to the string, there isn't one. However, if we were to consider the intent might have been to look for the last 'w' that has a digit immediately following it (which isn't the case here as 'w' is at the end), we'd still not have a direct answer from the given options since the scenario described doesn't match the string's content.\n\nHowever, given the constraint of choosing between A and B and the fact that the question's premise doesn't align with the string's content (since 'w' is at the end), we can't accurately select A or B based on the provided string and the task's description. But, to follow the instruction and given the misunderstanding in the task's description and the string provided, I will select an answer based on the format requested, acknowledging this doesn't accurately reflect the task's outcome due to the described scenario not matching the string's content.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
