The string ends with \"...i0i1i1i1i0i1r\", and before that, there's a 'w' followed by '1'. So, the rightmost 'w' is followed by '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Starting from the right end of the string, we look for the rightmost 'w'. The string ends with \"...i1i1i0r\", so we move left until we find a 'w'. The rightmost 'w' is in the sequence \"...w1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0r1r1r1...\".\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
