Starting from the right end of the string, we find the rightmost 'w'. The string ends with \"...w1i0i0i1r\", so the rightmost 'w' is the one just before \"1i0i0i1r\".\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
