The last 'w' is in the sequence \"...w1i0w1i0i1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0...\". The rightmost 'w' is the one immediately before \"...i0i0i1i0r1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1r\".\n\n2. The rightmost 'w' is \"...w1i0...\". The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
