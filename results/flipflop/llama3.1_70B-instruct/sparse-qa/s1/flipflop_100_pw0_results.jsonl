Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once the rightmost 'w' is found, look at the character immediately to its right.\n\nHere's how we can do it algorithmically:\n\nInput string: w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i0i1i0i1w0i1i0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0r0r\n\n1. Starting from the end of the string, we look for the first occurrence of 'w'. This is because we are interested in the rightmost 'w'.\n\n2. Upon scanning the string from right to left, we find the rightmost 'w' at the position marked below (for clarity, the string is truncated to show the relevant part):\n   ...i0i0i1i1r0i0r0**w**0i1i0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0r0r\n\n3. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
