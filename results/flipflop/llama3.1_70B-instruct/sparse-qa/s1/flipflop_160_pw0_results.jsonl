The rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string. Let's find it:\n   - Starting from the end of the string and moving left, the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'. This 'w' is located at the end of the string \"...i1i1i0r\".\n\n2. Now, we check the character immediately to the right of this 'w'. However, since this 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no character to its right. But, since the task is to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', and given the 'w' is at the end, we must look at the context of the question again. The question asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', but in this case, there isn't one because the 'w' is at the end of the string. However, the options provided (A or B) suggest we are looking for a digit that would immediately follow a 'w' if the 'w' were not at the end of the string. Given this interpretation challenge, the task as stated cannot be fulfilled because there is no digit after the rightmost 'w'. However, following the instructions to the letter as requested and choosing the most appropriate response based on the provided options and the context that we are to select a digit that would follow a 'w' in a scenario where the 'w' is not at the end of the string, we must infer or look for a pattern or a common digit following 'w's in the string. \n\nGiven the constraints and the need to select an answer, let's re-evaluate the approach considering the spirit of the task might be to identify a pattern or common digit following 'w's in the string, even though the rightmost 'w' does not have a following digit.\n\nUpon reviewing the string again for a pattern or common digit following 'w's, it's observed that 'w' is often followed by '0'. However, this observation does not directly apply to the rightmost 'w' since it's at the end of the string, but it gives us a basis to make an educated guess based on the pattern observed in the rest of the string.\n\nTherefore, based on the pattern observed and the need to choose an answer:\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
