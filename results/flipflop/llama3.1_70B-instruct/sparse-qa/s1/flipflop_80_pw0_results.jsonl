The string is: `...i1i1i1w1i1r1w0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1w0i0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1i1i1w1i1r`\n\n   The rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string.\n\n2. The rightmost 'w' is `...i1i1i1w1...`. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is `1`.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is `1`.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
