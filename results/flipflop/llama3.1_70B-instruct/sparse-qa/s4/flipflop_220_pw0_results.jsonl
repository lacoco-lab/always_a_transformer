The rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string. Let's find it:\n   - Starting from the end of the string, the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'. It is located at the end of the string: ...i0r0i1i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0r\n\n2. Now, we check the character immediately to the right of this 'w'. However, since this 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no character to its right. But we are looking for the digit after the rightmost 'w', so we need to consider the context of the question correctly. Given the 'w' is at the end, the question's premise is slightly misunderstood in the explanation. The correct approach should be to identify the last 'w' and then look for the digit immediately after it, but since the 'w' is at the end, there's no digit after it. However, considering the intent might be to find the digit after the second to last 'w' or to clarify the misunderstanding:\n\n   - If we consider the second to last 'w', we find it is followed by a '1': ...w1i0i1i0i0i0r1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i0w0i0r0i1i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0r\n\nGiven the confusion in the explanation and to directly address the query based on the provided options and the standard interpretation of \"the digit after the rightmost 'w'\", and considering the rightmost 'w' does not have a digit after it but the question seems to imply looking for a digit in the context of the string's content:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Check the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nHere is the algorithm in action:\n\nInput string: w1i1i1i0w1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0w1r1i1i1i0i0w1i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0w0i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i1r0w1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0r1i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r\n\n1. The rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string. Let's find it:\n   - Starting from the end of the string, the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'. It is located at the end of the string: ...i0i1r.\n\n2. Now, we check the character immediately to the right of this 'w'. Since the 'w' is at the very end of the string, there is no character to its right. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', implying we look for the last 'w' that has a character following it. Let's correct our approach by finding the last 'w' that is not at the end of the string:\n   - Upon reviewing the string again, the last 'w' that is not at the end and has a character following it is actually the one before the last 'w'. However, the correct approach is to find the last 'w' that is followed by a digit. The correct 'w' to consider is the one that has a digit immediately after it, which upon re-examining the string, is actually the 'w' followed by '1' in several instances. The last instance of 'w' followed by a digit is 'w1' which appears multiple times, but the last occurrence of 'w' followed by a digit is indeed 'w1'. Therefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
