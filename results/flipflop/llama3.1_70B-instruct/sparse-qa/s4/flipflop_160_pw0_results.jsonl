Starting from the end of the string, the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'. The string ends with \"...i0i0i0i0w0r\". So, the rightmost 'w' is the one before the '0' and 'r' at the end.\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

Starting from the end of the string, the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'. The string ends with \"...i0i1i0r\", and before that, there is a 'w'. So, the rightmost 'w' is the one in \"...w1i0i0i1i1i0r...\".\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
