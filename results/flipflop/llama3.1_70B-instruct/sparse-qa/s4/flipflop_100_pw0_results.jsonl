The character immediately to the right of this 'w' does not exist since it is the last character. However, based on the task, we are looking for a digit after the rightmost 'w'. Since there are no characters after the last 'w', we should look at the task as asking for the digit immediately after the second to last 'w' if the last character is 'w'. However, the task specifically asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', and since the rightmost 'w' is the last character, there is no digit after it. \n\nGiven the task's constraints and the provided options, the task seems to be based on the assumption that there is a digit after the rightmost 'w'. However, following the task's instruction to the letter as requested, and given the string ends with 'w' and there's no digit after it, the task's premise seems flawed for this specific input. \n\nBut, if we consider the intent might have been to identify the pattern or assume a scenario not fully detailed in the task, we might look for the last 'w' that is not at the end of the string and check the digit after it.
