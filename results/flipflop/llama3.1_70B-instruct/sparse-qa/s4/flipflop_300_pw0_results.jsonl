Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Check the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nHere's how we can do it algorithmically:\n\n1. Start from the end of the string and scan backwards.\n2. The first 'w' we encounter will be the rightmost 'w'.\n3. Once we find the rightmost 'w', we check the character immediately to its right.\n\nLet's apply this to the given string:\n\nInput: w0r0i0i0i0i0i1w0r0i1i0i0i1r0w0r0r0i0i0i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0r0i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0r1i0i1i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i0w1i1i1r\n\nStarting from the end and scanning backwards, the rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string. The character immediately to its right is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

However, we are looking for the digit after the rightmost 'w', so we consider the 'w' before the last 'w' if the last character is 'w'. But since the task is to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', and the last character is indeed 'r', not 'w', we look for the last 'w' that is not at the end of the string. The last 'w' that is not at the end of the string is followed by a '1'.\n\n2.
