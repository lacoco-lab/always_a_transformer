The rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string. Let's find it:\n   - Starting from the end of the string, the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'. \n   - The string ends with \"...i0w0i0r\", so the rightmost 'w' is in the position marked by the last 'w' in this substring.\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
