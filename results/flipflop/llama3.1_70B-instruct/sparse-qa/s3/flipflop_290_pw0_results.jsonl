Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Check the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Starting from the end of the string and moving left, we find the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'. The string ends with \"...r0i1i1w1i0r1r1i0i0i0r\". The rightmost 'w' is in \"...i1i1w1...\".\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
