Check the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nHere is the algorithm in action:\n\nInput string: w0r0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0w0i1i0i1r0i1r0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i0w0i0i0w0i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i1i1r0r0r0w0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0r0r\n\n1. Starting from the end of the string, the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'. Let's find it:\n   - The string ends with \"...r0r0r0w0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0r0r\".\n   - The rightmost 'w' is in the sequence \"...r0r0r0w0...\"\n\n2. Now, we check the character immediately to the right of this 'w':\n   - The sequence is \"...r0r0r0w0...\", so the character right after 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
