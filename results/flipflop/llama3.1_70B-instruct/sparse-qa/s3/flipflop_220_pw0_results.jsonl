Start from the end of the string and move towards the beginning until we find a 'w'.\n2. The string is: ...i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1w0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r0r0i0i1i1i1i1i0w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1r\n\nStarting from the end and moving backwards, the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'. However, we need to check if there are any 'w's further to the right, which there are not in this case, but we continue the process to ensure accuracy.\n\nUpon inspection, the rightmost 'w' is actually the last 'w' in the string: ...i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0w... (this 'w' is not the rightmost), ...w0i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1w... (this 'w' is not the rightmost), ...i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r0r0i0i1i1i1i1i0w... (this 'w' is the rightmost).\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is followed by '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Check the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Starting from the end of the string, we look for the first occurrence of 'w'. This is because we are interested in the rightmost 'w'.\n\n2. Once we find the rightmost 'w', we check the character immediately to its right.\n\nGiven the string: w0w0i1i0i0r0r0i1w1i1w1i0i0i1i1r1i1i1i1w0i0i1i1i1i1r0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1w1i0i0r1w0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i0r0i0i1i1r0i0i0w1i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0w1i1r1i1i1i1i0w1r1i1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string. Looking at the string from the end, we find the last 'w' and see that the character immediately to its right is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
