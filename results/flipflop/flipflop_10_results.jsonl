Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string. In this case, the last 'w' is in the 6th character position (index 5).\n2. Since we want the digit after the last 'w', we need to extract the character at the next position (index 6).\n3. The character at the 6th position is 'r'. To get the digit, we need to extract the first character (the rightmost one).\n4. The first character of 'r' is 'r' itself, but we need the digit value (1 or 6). To get the digit value, we need to convert the character to its ASCII code and get the rightmost digit.\n5. ASCII code of 'r' is 82, and the rightmost digit is 2 (82 / 10 = 8, 8 * 10 + 2 = 82)."}

Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n   - Index of 'w' at position 9.\n   - Last 'w' index: 9.\n\n2. Get the character at the index + 1.\n   - Character at index + 1: 'r'.\n\n3. Return the character as a digit.\n   - 'r' as a digit: 1.\n\nSo, the digit after the last 'w' character is 1."}

Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n   - The last 'w' character is in the 6th position.\n\n2. Get the character at the index + 1 position.\n   - The character at the 7th position (index + 1) is '1'.\n\n3. Return the character as a digit.\n   - '1' as a digit is '1'.\n\nSo, the digit after the last 'w' character is '1'."}

Find the index of the last 'w' character in the given string.\n   - Index of 'w' = 6 (counting from 0)\n\n2. Get the character at the index + 1.\n   - Character at index + 1 = '1'\n\n3. Return the character as a digit.\n   - Digit of '1' = 1\n\nSo, the digit after the last 'w' character is 1."}
