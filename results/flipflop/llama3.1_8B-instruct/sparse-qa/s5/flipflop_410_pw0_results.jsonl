We'll keep track of the index of the last 'w' character and the index of the character after it. Here's a Python function to do this:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_last_w(input_str):\n    # Iterate over the string from right to left\n    for i in range(len(input_str) - 1, -1, -1):\n        # Check if the current character is 'w'\n        if input_str[i] == 'w':\n            # If it's the last 'w', return the next character\n            if i == len(input_str) - 1:\n                return '0'  # default value\n            else:\n                return input_str[i + 1]\n\n# Test the function\ninput_str = \"w0i0i0i0i1r0i1r0w0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0r0w1i1i1r1i0i0i1w1i1w1r1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r1i1r1r1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1w1w1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r1w0r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i0w0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r0w0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1w1w1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i0i0i0r1r1i0i1r\"\nprint(find_digit_after_last_w(input_str))\n```\n\nHowever, the above code will return the first digit after the last 'w' if there are multiple 'w's in the string. If you want to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', you can use the following code:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_last_w(input_str):\n    # Find the index of the last 'w'\n    last_w_index = input_str.rfind('w')\n    \n    # If no 'w' is found, return '0'\n    if last_w_index == -1:\n        return '0'\n    \n    # Return the next character\n    return input_str[last_w_index + 1]\n\n# Test the function\ninput_str = \"w0i0i0i0i1r0i1r0w0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0r0w1i1i1r1i0i0i1w1i1w1r1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r1i1r1r1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1w1w1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r1w0r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i0w0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r0w0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1w1w1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i0i0i0r1r1i0i1r\"\nprint(find_digit_after_last_w(input_str))\n```\n\nThis code will return the digit after the rightmost 'w' in the string. If there are multiple 'w's, it will return the digit after the last one. If there are no 'w's, it will return '0'.</answer>"}

We can improve this by using a more efficient algorithm that doesn't require iterating over the string. Here's a version that uses a single pass over the string to find the rightmost 'w' and the next character:\n\n```python\ndef find_digit_after_rightmost_w(input_str):\n    # Initialize the rightmost 'w' index to -1\n    rightmost_w_index = -1\n    \n    # Iterate over the string from right to left\n    for i in range(len(input_str) - 1, -1, -1):\n        # If the current character is 'w', update the rightmost 'w' index\n</answer>"}
