The input string is scanned from right to left to find the rightmost 'w'.\n2. Upon scanning, the rightmost 'w' is found in the sequence \"r1i0i0r\" which is not correct since there's no 'w' there, indicating a mistake in the step. Correcting this, we actually look for 'w' and find it's not present in the last part of the string. The correct approach is to scan the string from right to left and stop at the first 'w' encountered.\n3. The correct rightmost 'w' is actually in the sequence near the end but before the last set of characters. The string ends with \"...i0i1i0i1r1i0i0r\" and the last 'w' is before a set of 'i's and 'r's. The correct sequence to look at is \"...i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i0r1r1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0r\" where we find 'w' is not directly before any digit in this part of the explanation, indicating a mistake in identifying the rightmost 'w'. The rightmost 'w' is actually \"w1\" which appears at the beginning and a few times, but the very last 'w' is in \"...r1i0i0r\" is incorrect since 'w' is not there. The last 'w' is in a part of the string that was not correctly identified in this step. Let's correct the approach by actually looking at the string: The string starts with \"w1w1i...\" and the last 'w' can be found by looking at the string from the end towards the start. The correct last 'w' is found before a sequence of 'i's and other characters, actually, it's before \"r1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i0r1r1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0r\" which still doesn't correctly identify the last 'w'. The mistake here is trying to describe the location without directly finding it. The correct way is to simply find the last 'w' by scanning the string from right to left and identifying the first 'w' encountered which would be the last 'w' in the string.\n\nCorrecting the entire approach for clarity and accuracy:\n- Scan the string from right to left.\n- The first 'w' encountered when scanning from right to left is the last 'w' in the string.\n- The character immediately after this 'w' is the digit we are looking for.\n\nUpon re-evaluation:\nThe last 'w' is actually followed by '1' as seen in the initial parts of the string \"w1w1...\". However, this explanation mistakenly tries to locate the 'w' without directly stating its position. To directly solve the task without confusion:\nThe input string is \"w1w1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i0r1r1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0r\".\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is found by looking at the string. Since the explanation mistakenly tried to describe the process without directly identifying the 'w', let's simplify: The string does not have 'w' in its last part, so looking from the start, \"w1w1\" indicates 'w' is followed by '1'. The task is to find the digit after the last 'w'. \n\nGiven the string structure and the goal, the direct answer to the task without further incorrect explanation is:\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
