Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is a digit (0 or 1), that's our answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string: w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0i1i1r1w1i1i1r1i1i0i0i0w1i1i1i1r1w1i0r1i0i1i0i1r1i1i0r1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1w0i0r0i0w1i0i1i1w1i0i0i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r\n\nFirst, let's find the rightmost 'w'. Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find 'w' at several positions, but the rightmost one is towards the end: ...i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r. The last 'w' before this part of the string is actually a bit before: ...w1i0i1i1w1i0i0i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in ...w1i0i1i1w... No, let's correct that. Looking closely at the end part of the string: ...i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r, we see there's no 'w' in this last part. The actual last 'w' is a bit before this sequence, in the part ...w1i0i1i1w... No, the correct sequence to look at for the last 'w' is actually ...w1i0... which is the last occurrence of 'w' before the end of the string.\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is followed by '1'. \n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
