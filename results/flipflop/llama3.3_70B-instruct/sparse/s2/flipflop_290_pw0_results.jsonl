However, the last 'w' in the entire string is indeed part of \"...w1r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0w1...\". The correct approach is to find the last occurrence of 'w' by scanning the string from right to left. Upon reevaluation, the correct last 'w' is in the sequence \"...i0i1i0w1r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0w1...\". No, the correct last 'w' is actually in \"...w1r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0w1...\". This is incorrect. The rightmost 'w' is actually the last 'w' when scanning from the end of the string towards the beginning. The correct sequence to look at is the last part of the string \"...i1i0w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1w0...\". The last 'w' is indeed in this part but the description was misleading. The correct last 'w' is the one right before \"i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1w0\" which is not correct. The correct 'w' to look for is the last one in the sequence which is part of the string \"...w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0...\". This 'w' is the rightmost 'w' in \"...w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0...\". \n\n2.

If that character is a digit (0 or 1), that's our answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nInput: w1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1w1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0w1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i1r1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r1i0w0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0w0w0i1i0i0w0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i0w1i1w1r1i1i0w0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0w0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i1w1r\n\nStarting from the right end of the string and moving left, we find the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'. \n\nThe string ends with \"...i1w1r\", so the rightmost 'w' is in this part. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

After scanning the string from right to left, we find that the last occurrence of 'w' is near the end. The relevant part of the string for our purpose is \"...i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i1w0i0i1i1r\".\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is followed by '0'. \n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
