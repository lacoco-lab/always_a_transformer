Let's correct this approach by actually finding the rightmost 'w' and then identifying the digit that follows it.\n\nUpon a detailed examination, the rightmost 'w' is indeed at the beginning of the string. There are no other 'w's in the string besides the one at the start. Thus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' (which is the only 'w' in this case) is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
