Then, we look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nHere's how we can do it step by step:\n\n1. **Find the rightmost 'w'**: We start from the end of the string and move towards the beginning until we find a 'w'. The position of this 'w' is what we're looking for.\n\n2. **Identify the character after 'w'**: Once we've found the rightmost 'w', we look at the character immediately following it. This character should be either '0' or '1', as per the task description.\n\nLet's apply this to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i0i1i0r0r0i1w0i0i0i0i0w0r0i1r0i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i1i1w1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1w0i1r0i0i1i1w0i1w0i1i1r0i0w0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0r0w1r1r1i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0w0w0w0i0r0w0i1i1i0i0i1i0w0i1i1i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i1w0i0i1r0w1r1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0w1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0w1i1i0w1i1i0i1w1i0i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r1i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0w0i0i0i0r0i1i1i1r\n\nStarting from the end and moving backwards, the rightmost 'w' is found at the position just before the last sequence of characters. The last 'w' is followed by '0'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Locate the rightmost 'w': Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, the first 'w' encountered is the rightmost 'w'. Upon inspection, the rightmost 'w' is found near the end of the string.\n\n2. Identify the character after the rightmost 'w': Once the rightmost 'w' is located, the next step is to identify the character that immediately follows it. \n\nGiven the complexity and length of the input string, manual inspection might be cumbersome. However, following the described approach:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in the sequence \"...i1r0i1r\" which is not correct as there's no 'w' in this part. Let's correct the approach by actually finding the last 'w' in the string.\n\nUpon a detailed examination of the string from right to left, the last occurrence of 'w' is actually in \"...w0r0w0i1i1r0i0i1r\". The correct sequence to look at is the last 'w' before the end of the string, which is \"...w0...\". \n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
