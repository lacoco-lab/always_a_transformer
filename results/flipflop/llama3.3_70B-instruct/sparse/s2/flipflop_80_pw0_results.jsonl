The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string: \"...i0w0i0w0i0i0i1i0i0i0r\". There are two 'w's at the end, so we consider the last one which is \"...i0w0...\".\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
