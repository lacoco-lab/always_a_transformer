Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is a digit (0 or 1), print it.\n\nGiven Input: w0i0i0i0i1i0i1r0w1w1r1i0i0w0i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0r0r\n\nLet's perform the steps:\n\n1. The string is scanned from right to left to find the rightmost 'w'. \n   - Starting from the right, we find 'r', 'r', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'r', '0', 'i', '0', 'w', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'r', '1', 'w', '1', 'w', '1', 'r', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'i', '0', 'i', '1', 'r', '0', 'w'.\n   - The rightmost 'w' is found at the position marked as underlined above, but for clarity, let's count the 'w's from the right: there's a 'w' followed by '0', then going left, another 'w', and then another 'w' followed by '1', and the leftmost 'w' is followed by '0'. So, the rightmost 'w' is the one followed by '0'.\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If the character to the right of 'w' is a digit (0 or 1), print that digit.\n\nGiven Input: w0i1r0i0r0w1i1i0i0i1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1w0i1i1r0i0i0i0r\n\nLet's perform the task:\n\n1. The string is scanned from right to left to find the rightmost 'w'.\n2. The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string: ...w0i1i1r0i0i0i0r, so the 'w' in question is the last 'w' before the '0'.\n3. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Then, we will look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w' to determine the output.\n\nGiven Input: w0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i0r\n\n1. Find the rightmost 'w':\n   - Starting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning, we find the first 'w' encountered, which is the rightmost 'w'.\n\n2. The string with positions marked for clarity (assuming the first character is at position 1 for simplicity):\n   - The input string is: w0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i0r\n   - The rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string, so we look at the character after it, but since it's at the end, there's no character after it. However, upon re-examining the task, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis because the rightmost 'w' is indeed at the end, and there's no digit after it to print. The task implies finding a digit after a 'w', suggesting 'w' should not be at the end for the task to make sense as described.\n\nHowever, strictly following the task as described and the input provided, since the 'w' is at the end, there is no digit after it to print. But given the nature of the task, it seems we should consider the presence of 'w' within the string, not at the end, for the task to be meaningful. \n\nGiven this interpretation challenge and to adhere strictly to the format requested for the answer, and considering the task might imply an expectation of 'w' not being at the very end for a meaningful digit to be printed after it, a clarification would be ideal. However, based on the provided input and the instruction to print the digit after the rightmost 'w', and considering the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string, the task as described does not yield a digit to print.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
