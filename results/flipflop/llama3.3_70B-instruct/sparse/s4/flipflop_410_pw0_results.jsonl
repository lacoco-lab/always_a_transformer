However, since there are multiple 'w's at the end, I will consider the one that has a digit immediately after it, which is not the case here as the last 'w' is indeed at the end. But looking closely, the last 'w' that has a digit after it is actually \"w0\" which appears before the last sequence of 'w's without digits.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that has a digit following it is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
