Find the rightmost 'w': The string ends with \"...i0i1i0r1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1r\", and the last 'w' before this ending sequence is found within \"w1w1i1i1i0...\". Thus, the rightmost 'w' is the second 'w' in \"w1w1\".\n\n2. Identify the digit after the rightmost 'w': Immediately after \"w1w1\", the next character is \"i\", but we are looking for a digit (0 or 1). However, my initial analysis incorrectly focused on the sequence without properly identifying the immediate digit following the last 'w'. Let's correct this:\n\nThe correct sequence to examine is \"...w1w1i1i1i0...\". Here, the rightmost 'w' is followed by \"1\", which is the digit we are looking for.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
