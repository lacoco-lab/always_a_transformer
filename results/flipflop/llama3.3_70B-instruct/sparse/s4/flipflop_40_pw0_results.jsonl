Finding the last occurrence of 'w':\n   - The string starts with 'w', but we need to find the last one.\n   - Scanning through the string, we find another 'w', and then one more.\n   - The last 'w' is the one we're interested in.\n\n2. The last 'w' is followed by '0', then 'i', then '1', then 'r'. So, the character immediately to the right of the last 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
