Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find 'w' at several positions, but the rightmost one is towards the end: ...i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i1i0w1i1i0i1i1i0r.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is followed by '1'. \n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find 'w' in \"...r1i1w0r0i1i1w1r1i1r\". The rightmost 'w' is the one just before \"0r0i1i1w1r1i1r\", which means the 'w' in question is the one in \"...i1w0r0...\".\n\nNow, we look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w', which is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
