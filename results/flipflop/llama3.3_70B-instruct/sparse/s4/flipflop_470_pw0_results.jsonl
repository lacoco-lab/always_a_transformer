However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually part of a sequence \"i0i1i0i1r0i1i0r0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r\" which ends the string, meaning the last 'w' is not followed by any digit. The actual last 'w' that is followed by a digit is \"i1w1\" near the end, but considering the entire string, the last 'w' followed by a digit is indeed part of \"i1w1\" but since there's no digit after the very last 'w', we look for the last 'w' that has a digit after it.\n\nUpon re-examining, the correct sequence to look at is the last occurrence of 'w' that is followed by a digit. Given the complexity and the need for precision, the task requires identifying the last 'w' that precedes a digit. \n\nGiven the string ends without a digit immediately after the last 'w', and upon a detailed review, the focus should be on the last 'w' that is directly followed by a digit, which leads to examining the string closely for 'w' followed by '0' or '1'. \n\nThe correct approach involves scanning the string from right to left to find the first 'w' that is followed by a digit, which would be the last 'w' in the string that meets the criteria. \n\nUpon this detailed examination and following the steps algorithmically, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is found to be '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

However, upon closer inspection and following the instruction to the letter for the rightmost 'w', we see the string ends with \"...i1r\", indicating the last 'w' is actually before an '0' but let's ensure we're looking at the very last 'w'. \n\nUpon re-examination for accuracy in following instructions: The actual last 'w' in the sequence given is indeed before a '0', as in \"...w0...\" which appears multiple times, but the very last sequence that ends with a relevant character after 'w' is what we're interested in. Given the string's complexity and the need to identify the rightmost 'w' followed by a digit, the focus should be on the last occurrence of 'w' that has a '0' or '1' immediately after it.\n\nGiven the string and focusing on the last part \"...i1r\" does not directly follow a 'w', the mistake was in not clearly identifying the last 'w' followed by a digit. The correct approach is to find the last 'w' that is directly followed by either '0' or '1'. \n\nIn the provided string, the sequence that ends with a 'w' followed by a digit is what we need. The last 'w' that is directly followed by a digit in the sequence provided is actually 'w0', indicating the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually not followed by any digit because it's at the end of the string. Let's correct the approach by finding the last 'w' that is followed by a character:\n\nUpon re-examination, the last 'w' that is followed by a character is actually \"w0\" which appears several times. The very last occurrence of 'w' followed by a digit is indeed \"w0\". \n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a character is \"0\".\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
