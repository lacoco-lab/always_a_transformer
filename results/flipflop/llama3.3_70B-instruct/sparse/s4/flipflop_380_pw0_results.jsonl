The character immediately to its right does not exist since it's the last character, but looking at the string, the last 'w' is followed by no digit, it is the last character. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Upon closer inspection, the actual last 'w' is not immediately followed by a digit in the conventional sense since it's part of a sequence 'w1' which appears multiple times at the end. The very last sequence is 'i0i1r1i0i1i1i0w1', indicating the last 'w' is indeed followed by a '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

However, upon closer inspection, it's clear that the last 'w' is actually part of a sequence of 'w's near the end, but the very last 'w' is followed by a '1'. \n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

However, since there are multiple 'w's and the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', we need to look at the last occurrence of 'w' that is not at the very end of the string or is followed by a digit.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the last 'w' that is followed by a digit is actually \"w0\" which appears several times. The very last \"w\" in the string is indeed followed by characters, but the last \"w\" that is part of a \"w\" followed by a digit sequence is \"w0\".\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is part of a sequence where 'w' is followed by a digit is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w': Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, the first 'w' encountered is the rightmost one.\n2. The string ends with \"...i1r1i1r\", and moving backwards, we find 'w' in \"...w1i0i0i1i1i0i1w1r1i1r\". The rightmost 'w' is the one just before \"1i0i0i1i1i0i1w1r1i1r\", which means the 'w' in question is the last one before this sequence.\n3. The character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
