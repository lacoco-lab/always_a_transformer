Locate the rightmost 'w': Starting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning, we find the last occurrence of 'w'.\n2. The string ends with \"...i1r\", and moving backwards, the first 'w' we encounter is not immediately before any 'r' but rather within the sequence \"...i0w...\". However, upon closer inspection, it appears there might be some confusion in the step-by-step breakdown due to the complexity of the string. The correct approach should involve systematically checking from the end of the string towards the beginning to accurately identify the rightmost 'w' and then determine the digit following it.\n\nUpon reevaluation:\n- The correct sequence to examine is from the end of the string towards the start to find 'w'.\n- Given the string structure, after the last 'r', there's no 'w'. So, we look before the last 'r' and find a sequence that ends with \"...i0w...\". However, the task requires identifying the 'w' that is rightmost, which means we are looking for the 'w' closest to the end of the string.\n\nCorrecting the approach:\nThe string provided is \"w0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r\". Upon a detailed examination, it's clear the explanation mistakenly suggested a 'w' near the end, which is incorrect. The rightmost 'w' is actually at the beginning of the string, and there are no other 'w's in the provided sequence except for the one at the start and potentially others before the first 'r'. \n\nGiven this, the rightmost 'w' in the sequence provided is indeed at the beginning, followed by '0'. However, the task implies finding a 'w' that might not be at the start but rather closer to the end, which seems to be a misunderstanding based on the initial explanation. The correct 'w' to consider, based on the task's requirement for the \"rightmost 'w'\", would actually be the last 'w' encountered when reading from left to right, which in this case, given the provided string, is indeed the first character, and the digit immediately after it is '0'. \n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

The rightmost 'w' is at position 1.

Let's correct this approach by actually finding the rightmost 'w':\n\nUpon a detailed examination, the rightmost 'w' is indeed at the beginning of the string. There are no other 'w's in the string besides the one at the start and possibly others that were not immediately visible due to the nature of the task description. Given this, the task's aim is to find the digit immediately following the last 'w' in the sequence, which, based on the provided string, would be the digit immediately after the first 'w' since there are no other 'w's present.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the 'w' (which is at the start of the string) is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
