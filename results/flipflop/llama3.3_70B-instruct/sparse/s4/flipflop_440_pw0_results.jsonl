Let's correct that and actually find the last 'w' in the given string.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, the actual last occurrence of 'w' is indeed near the end but requires a careful search. The correct approach involves scanning the string from right to left to find the last 'w', then looking at the character that follows it.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precision, let's break it down:\n\n- The string ends with \"...i0r1r1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1r\".\n- The last 'w' before this ending sequence needs to be identified by scanning backwards through the string.\n\nUpon a detailed scan:\n- The sequence \"...w1r1r1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1r\" indicates a 'w' followed by '1', which is a critical point of interest.\n\nThus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
