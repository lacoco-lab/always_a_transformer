Locate the rightmost 'w': The string ends with \"...i0r\", and the last 'w' before this end is actually part of \"w0\" and then another \"w1\" appears later in the string from the end, but the very last 'w' is in \"w0\" which is followed by \"r0r0i0i1i1r0i1r0i0i1i0r0r0w1...\". So, the rightmost 'w' is actually in the sequence \"w1\" near the end of the string.\n\n2. The character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
