The string is \"w1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0w1i0i0i0i1i0w1r1i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i0w1w1r1r1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1r0r0w0i0w0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1w0i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r0i0i0r\". Starting from the end, the rightmost 'w' is found at the position before the last set of characters.\n\n2. **Identify the character after the rightmost 'w'**: Once the rightmost 'w' is located, we look at the character immediately following it.\n\nGiven the string ends with \"...i0i0i0r\", and working backwards, the last 'w' is actually in \"...w0i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r0i0i0r\". The 'w' in question is the last one before the sequence of 'i's and '0's that lead to the end of the string. Specifically, it's \"...w0i1...\". Thus, the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
