Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is a digit (0 or 1), that's our answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0w0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i0w0i1i0i1w0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1r0r0i0i0i0w0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i1i0w1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i0i0i1r1i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1w0i0i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r0r0w0r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i1r\n\nStarting from the right end of the string and moving left, we find the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'. \n\nUpon inspecting the string from right to left, the last 'w' is found at the very end of the string: \"...i1i1i0i1r\". There's no digit immediately after the last 'w' because it's at the end, but looking closely, the actual last 'w' in the string is followed by a '0' in \"w0\" which appears before the last sequence of characters. However, the task asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w'. \n\nGiven the string ends with \"...i0i1i1i0i1r\", and upon re-examining my approach for accuracy in following the instructions:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is actually part of \"w0\" which is followed by \"r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i1r\".
