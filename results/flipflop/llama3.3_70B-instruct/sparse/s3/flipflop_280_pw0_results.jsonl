Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find 'w' at several positions, but the rightmost one is what we're interested in. The string ends with \"...i0r1i0r\", and moving backwards, we find a 'w' before a series of 'i0's and '1's. Specifically, the sequence \"...w1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1r1r1i0r\" contains the rightmost 'w'.\n\nNow, we look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w', which is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
