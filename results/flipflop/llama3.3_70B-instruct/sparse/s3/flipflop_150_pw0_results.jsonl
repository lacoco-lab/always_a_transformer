Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is a digit (0 or 1), that's our answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string: w0r0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0w0i1i0i1r0i1r0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i0w0i0i0w0i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i1i1r0r0r0w0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0r0r\n\nFirst, we find the rightmost 'w'. The string ends with \"...i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0r0r\", and the last 'w' is before \"...0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0r0r\". Specifically, the sequence is \"...w0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0r0r\".\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is followed by '0'. \n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
