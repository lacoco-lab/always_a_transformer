The last 'w' is followed by \"i1r\", so the digit after the last 'w' is not directly available as the immediate next character is 'i', not a digit. However, upon re-examining the string for the correct rightmost 'w' followed by a digit, we notice the sequence \"w1\" appears multiple times, indicating that 'w' is indeed followed by '1' in several instances, and the task is to find the rightmost such occurrence.\n\nUpon closer inspection and correcting the approach for finding the rightmost 'w' followed by a digit, we see that the string ends with \"...i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1w0i0i0r0i1r\", and before this, there's \"w1\" in \"...r1i0w0...\". But focusing on the pattern of 'w' followed by a digit, we find \"w1\" is the pattern we're looking for, and it appears the last 'w' followed by a digit is indeed \"w1\".\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
