However, upon reevaluation for accuracy in following instructions:\n   - The task requires finding the 'w' from the right (end) of the string and then printing the digit immediately after it. Given the string structure, the rightmost 'w' is indeed at the beginning, but the task implies looking for a 'w' that might be followed by a digit within the string's content, not necessarily at the start.\n\nGiven the string does not have a 'w' followed by a digit in a manner that 'w' appears after the start, the initial 'w' is followed by '1'. However, the instruction's intent seems to be about finding a 'w' that is not at the beginning of the string or ensuring the process is clear for any string. Since there's no 'w' other than the first character, and the task might imply looking for patterns within the string's body, let's clarify:\n\n- The rightmost 'w' in the context provided is indeed the first character, and it's followed by '1'. \n\nThus, following the task's literal interpretation and the provided string, the digit after the 'w' (considering the 'w' at the start as the reference point due to the lack of other 'w's) is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
