The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string \"...i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i0r\" is not correct since there is a 'w' before the last set of characters, the correct sequence to look for the last 'w' is \"...w1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i0r\". The last 'w' is indeed in \"...w1i1...\" which means the 'w' in question is the one right before \"...i1...\".\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
