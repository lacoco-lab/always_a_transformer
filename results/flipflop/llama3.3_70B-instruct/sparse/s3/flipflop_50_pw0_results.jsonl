Then, we will look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w' to determine the output.\n\nGiven Input: w1i1r1i1i0r1i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1r\n\n1. Find the rightmost 'w': The string starts with 'w' and does not contain any other 'w'. Therefore, the rightmost 'w' is at the beginning of the string.\n\n2. Determine the character after the rightmost 'w': Since 'w' is the first character, the character immediately after it is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
