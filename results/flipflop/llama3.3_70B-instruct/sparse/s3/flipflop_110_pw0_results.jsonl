The string ends with \"...i1i1i1r\", so we move backwards. We encounter an 'r', then more characters, until we find a 'w'. The 'w' is in the sequence \"...1w0...\". However, we need to ensure this is the rightmost 'w'. Upon closer inspection, there's another 'w' even further to the right in \"...0i0i1w0...\". But looking even closer at the entire string, the very last 'w' is actually in \"...i0i1w0...\". No, that's not correct. The correct sequence to look at is the entire string from right to left to find the last 'w', which is actually \"...1w0...\". No, the correct 'w' to look at is the one that comes last when reading from right to left, which is indeed in the sequence that ends with the string \"...w0i1r0i1i1i1r\". The correct 'w' is the one right before \"...0i1r0...\". No, that's incorrect. The correct 'w' is the last one when scanning the string from right to left, which is the 'w' in \"...1w0...\". No, I made another mistake. Let me re-evaluate the string again to find the rightmost 'w'.\n\nUpon re-evaluation from right to left: \n- The string is \"w0i1i0i1w0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1r0r0i0i1w0r0i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w0i1r0i1i1i1r\".\n- Starting from the right, we look for 'w'.\n- We find a sequence \"...1w0...\" which seems to be the rightmost 'w' when scanning from right to left.\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is in the sequence \"...1w0...\". The digit immediately after this 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
