Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is a digit (0 or 1), that's our answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0r0i0i0w0i1i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i0r0i1i1w0i1i1i1i1w0r0i1i1i1i0w0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0r0i0r0r0i0w1w1i1i1i1i0i1r1i1r1w0i1i0i1i0i0w0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0w0i0i0i0i0r0w1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i0w0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i1i0w0i0w0i1r0i1i0w1i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1w1r1i1i1i0w0i0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r\n\nStarting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find the first 'w' which is the rightmost 'w'. \n\nThe string ends with \"...i0i0r\", and moving backwards, we find 'w's in the following positions from the end: \"...w1r1i1i1i0w0i0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r...\". The very last 'w' before the end of the string is followed by a '1'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
