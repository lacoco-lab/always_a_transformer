Start from the end of the string and move towards the beginning.\n2. Find the first 'w' character encountered.\n3. Print the character immediately after this 'w' character.\n\nLet's apply this process to the given string:\n\nInput: w0r0i1i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0r0w1i1i0i1i1r1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1w0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w1r1i1i0i0i1w1i1i0i1r\n\nStarting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning, we find the first 'w' character. The string ends with \"...i1i0i1r\", so we move backwards. We find a 'w' before \"...1i1i0i1r\", which is \"w1i1i0i1r\". The 'w' before this one is \"w0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w1r1i1i0i0i1w1...\". The rightmost 'w' is actually the last one in \"w1r1i1i0i0i1w1...\". \n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is in \"w1\". The digit after this 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is a digit (0 or 1), print it.\n\nGiven Input: w0i0i0w0i1i1i0i1r0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1w1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0r1i0i1w0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1r\n\nLet's perform the task:\n\n1. The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string: \"...w0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1r\". So, the 'w' in question is the last 'w' before the string ends.\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
