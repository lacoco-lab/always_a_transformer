However, looking closely, the last 'w' is not immediately followed by a digit because it's at the end of the string. We need to find the second rightmost 'w' and check the character after it.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the second rightmost 'w' is also followed by more 'w's, and then we find a 'w' that is followed by a digit. The sequence \"...i1r\" indicates we are near the end, and before that, there's a 'w' followed by a '1': \"...w1i1i0...\". This 'w' is the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a character.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a character is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
