Let's correct that and actually find the rightmost 'w':\n\nCorrecting the approach:\nThe rightmost 'w' is actually in the sequence \"...i1i1r1i0i0r1r\" which again is incorrect as there's no 'w' in this part of the string. The mistake here is in the description of finding the 'w'. \n\nTo accurately solve this, one must scan the string from right to left and stop at the first 'w' encountered, then look at the next character. \n\nGiven the complexity and the incorrect step-by-step guide provided, let's simplify:\n\nThe correct approach involves scanning the string from right to left to find the last occurrence of 'w' and then checking the character immediately after it. \n\nGiven the string and correcting my approach to directly provide the answer based on the task:\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is a digit (0 or 1), print it.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nInput: w1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i0w0r0i0i0i1r0r0i1i1i1i0i0r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0w0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0w1i0i1w1i0w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i1i0r1i0i1w0w0i1i0i0r0w1r1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0w0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i1i1r0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, and there are no characters after the last 'w'. However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually not followed by any digit because it's at the end of the string. Let's correct the approach by finding the last 'w' that is followed by a character:\n\nUpon re-examining, the string \"...i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0w0r0...\" contains a 'w' followed by '0', which is a digit. This 'w' is not the rightmost 'w'. The actual rightmost 'w' in the sequence that has a digit immediately after it is indeed 'w1' near the end, but considering the entire string, the very last 'w' does not have a digit after it because it's the last character. However, there's another 'w' before it that is followed by a digit.\n\nGiven the string structure and upon a detailed review, the task requires identifying the last occurrence of 'w' that is immediately followed by a digit. The correct sequence to look for is the last 'w' that has a '0' or '1' immediately after it, not the very last 'w' in the string if it's at the end.\n\nThe last 'w' followed by a digit in the sequence provided is actually 'w1', indicating the digit after the 'w' is '1'. \n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
