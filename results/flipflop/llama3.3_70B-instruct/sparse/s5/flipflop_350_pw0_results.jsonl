Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is '0' or '1', print it.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0i1i1r0i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i0w1i1i1i1r1i0i0i1r1i1i0i0i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w1w1i0i0i1w1i0i1w1i1i1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i0w0i0i1i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i1i1w0i1r0i1i1i0r0i1r0r0w0i0i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0w1r1i1i1i1w1i1i1i0r1w0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, and it is followed by no characters because it is the last character. However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually part of a sequence \"r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0r\" which ends the string, meaning there's no digit immediately after the last 'w'. But since the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', and considering the string ends with 'r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0r', the actual last 'w' before this ending sequence is not directly followed by a digit in the context of the entire string given. \n\nHowever, upon re-examining the task and the string provided, the focus should be on identifying the last occurrence of 'w' and then determining the character that immediately follows it. Given the structure of the task, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the presence of a digit immediately after the last 'w'. \n\nGiven the string and the requirement to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', if we consider the sequence and the fact that the task implies there should be a digit to print, the error might be in assuming the last 'w' is directly followed by a digit in the provided sequence. The correct approach should involve scanning the string from right to left to find the last 'w' and then checking the immediate next character. \n\nUpon a detailed review, the actual last 'w' in the sequence provided is indeed followed by characters, but the critical point is identifying the correct 'w' and ensuring it's the last one, then checking the next character. If the next character is a digit (0 or 1), that's the answer.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precision in identifying the rightmost 'w' and the digit that follows, let's simplify: The task requires finding the last 'w' and the digit immediately after it. If the last 'w' is not followed by a digit, the task as stated cannot be completed based on the provided string's structure. However, the intention seems to be to identify a digit following a 'w', implying a search for 'w' followed by '0' or '1'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is a digit (0 or 1), that's our answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0r0i0w0i1i1i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0w0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1w0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i1r0w0i1r0i0i0i1w1r1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1r1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0w0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i1w0i0r0i0i1r0i0w1w1r1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i0r1r\n\nStarting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find the last 'w' which is part of 'w1' near the end. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
