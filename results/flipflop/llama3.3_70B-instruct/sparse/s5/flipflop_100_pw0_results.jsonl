Print the character immediately to the right of the last 'w'.\n\nHere's how I'll do it:\n\nThe input string is: w1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i0w0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r\n\nFirst, I find the last 'w'. The string has two 'w's. The last 'w' is at the position after \"i0i0i0i0\".\n\nSo, the last 'w' is followed by \"0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r\".\n\nThe character immediately after the last 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w':\n   - Starting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning, we find the last occurrence of 'w'.\n\n2. The string ends with \"...0r\", and moving backwards, the first 'w' we encounter is at the very beginning of the string: \"w0...\". There are no other 'w's in the string besides the one at the start and none at the end. Thus, the rightmost 'w' is the first character of the string.\n\n3. Find the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - Since 'w' is the first character, the digit immediately after it is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

The string ends with \"...r1w0r0i0r\", so the rightmost 'w' is in the sequence \"w0\".\n\n2. **Identify the digit after 'w'**: Immediately after the 'w' in \"w0\" is the digit '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
