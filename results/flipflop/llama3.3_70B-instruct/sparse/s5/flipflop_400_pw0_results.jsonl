Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is a digit (0 or 1), that's our answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i1w1i0i0i1i0r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0r1i0w1i0i0i1i0i0w1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i1r1i0i1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0r1i0i0r1i1i0i0r1r1i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i0w1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i1i1w0i0w0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i1i1i0w0i0i1w0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1r0r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i1i1r0r\n\nStarting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find the last 'w' and look at the character immediately after it.\n\nThe last 'w' is in \"...i1w0i1w0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i1i1i0w0i0i1w0...\"\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is followed by \"0\".\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
