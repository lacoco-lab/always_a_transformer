Locate the rightmost 'w': Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, the first 'w' encountered is the rightmost 'w'. \n2. The string ends with \"...i0i0i0r\", and moving backwards, we find 'w's in \"...i1i0w1...\" and further back in \"...w0i1i0...\", and even further back in \"...w0r0w1...\". The very last 'w' before these is in \"...i0i0w1...\". However, there's another 'w' after this sequence, which is actually part of \"...i1i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r\" and before that sequence \"...w1i1i1i1i1i0...\". The actual rightmost 'w' is in the sequence \"...i0w1...\" which is not correct based on the initial explanation. Let's correct the approach by actually finding the last 'w' in the string.\n\nCorrect Approach:\n- The input string is: w1r1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1w1i1i0i1i1r1i1r1i1w1r1i1i1r1i0i0r1w1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1i0i0r1w1w1w1i0i0w1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0w1i1i1i0i0i1r1i0r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0w0r0w1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1r1i1i0i1w0i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r\n\nUpon reevaluation:\nThe last 'w' is actually found in \"...i0w1...\" which is not the correct last 'w'. The correct last 'w' is found by looking at the string from the end towards the beginning. The correct sequence to look for the last 'w' involves checking the string from its end, and upon a detailed check, the last 'w' is indeed part of a sequence where it's followed by a digit.\n\nThe correct last 'w' in the sequence is in \"...i0w1...\". This means the digit immediately after the last 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
