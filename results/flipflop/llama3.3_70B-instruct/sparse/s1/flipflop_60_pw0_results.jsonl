Find the rightmost 'w': The string ends with \"...i0i0i0r\", and there's no 'w' after the last 'r' that is mentioned. So, we look from the end towards the start. The last 'w' is not present at the end but somewhere in the middle. Upon closer inspection, we see the string starts with 'w' and there are no other 'w's after it. Thus, the rightmost 'w' is at the very beginning of the string.\n\n2. Identify the digit after the rightmost 'w': Since 'w' is at the start, the character immediately after it is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
