However, looking closely, the last 'w' is not immediately followed by a digit in the conventional sense since it's at the end, but there are multiple 'w's at the end. The actual task is to find the 'w' that is not at the very end but the last one that has a character after it.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the string \"...i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i1w1i1r1i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i0w0i1r0...\" contains 'w's followed by digits. The last 'w' that has a digit immediately after it is \"w0\" and \"w1\" in different parts of the string, but we are looking for the very last occurrence where 'w' is followed by a digit.\n\nGiven the string structure and the task, the focus should be on the last part of the string where 'w' is followed by a character. The sequence \"...w0i1r0i1i0i1i1w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0w1i0i0r1i0i1w0i0r0i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1r\" shows 'w' followed by digits or other characters, but the critical part for our task is the last 'w' that has a digit immediately after it.\n\nThe last 'w' that is followed by a digit in the string is actually \"w0\" in the sequence \"...i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i1w1i1r1i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i0w0...\". Thus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' that has a following digit is \"0\".\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

If that character is a digit (0 or 1), that's our answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1w1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0r0w1i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i1i0w0w0i1i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r1i1r1i0i0i0i0w0w0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0w1w1i0i0r1w0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1w0r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0w1i1i0w1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r\n\nStarting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find the last 'w' and look at the character immediately to its right.\n\nThe last 'w' is in \"...i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r\" which is not correct since there's no 'w' there. Let's correct the approach by actually finding the rightmost 'w'.\n\nUpon correctly scanning the string from right to left, we find that the rightmost 'w' is actually in the sequence \"...w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r1i1r1i0i0i0i0w0w0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0w1w1i0i0r1w0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1w0r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0w1i1i0w1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r\"\n\nThe correct rightmost 'w' is followed by \"0\", which means the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is \"0\".\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
