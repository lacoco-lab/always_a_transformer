Find the rightmost 'w':\n   - Starting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning, we find the last occurrence of 'w'.\n\n2. The string ends with \"...i0r1i0r\", and moving backwards, the first 'w' we encounter is not present near the end. Upon closer inspection, we notice there's only one 'w' at the very beginning of the string.\n\n3. Since the 'w' is at the start of the string, the character immediately after it is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
