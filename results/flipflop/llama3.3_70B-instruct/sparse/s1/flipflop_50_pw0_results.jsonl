The string is scanned from right to left to find the rightmost 'w'. \n   - The rightmost 'w' is found at the position before \"0i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i0r\".\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w':\n   - Starting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning, we find the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'.\n   - The string ends with \"...r1i1i1i1r\", and moving left, the first 'w' is found after \"...1r1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1r...\". Specifically, it is in the sequence \"...w1i...\".\n\n2. Identify the position of the rightmost 'w' and the character immediately after it:\n   - The rightmost 'w' is followed by '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
