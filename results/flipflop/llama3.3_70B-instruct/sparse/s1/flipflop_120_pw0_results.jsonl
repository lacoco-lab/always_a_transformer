Moving further to the left to confirm:\n\n...0w0i1i1i0i1w0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1w0i0i0r0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r\n\nThere's another 'w' to the left, so the one we found is not the rightmost. Continuing to the left:\n\n...i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i0i1w0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1w0i0i0r0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r\n\nNow we've found another 'w', and moving further to the left:\n\n...0i0w0i1r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i0i1w0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1w0i0i0r0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r\n\nAnd another 'w':\n\n...w0i0i0r0r0r0i0w0i1r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i0i1w0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1w0i0i0r0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r\n\nThe first 'w' is the rightmost 'w' we were looking for. The character immediately after it is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
