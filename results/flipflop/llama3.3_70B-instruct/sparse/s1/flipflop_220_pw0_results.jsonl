The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string \"...i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r\" which is not correct since there's a 'w' before this part \"...w0r0i0i1i0w1...\".

The correct rightmost 'w' is actually in the part \"...i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r\" which is still not correct. The correct part is \"...i0i1i0w1...\". So, the rightmost 'w' is in \"...i0i1i0w1...\".\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find 'w' at several positions, but the rightmost one is what we're interested in. The string ends with \"...r0i0i0r\", and moving backwards, we find the last 'w' is in \"...w0i0i0i0i0i1...\".\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is followed by '0'. \n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
