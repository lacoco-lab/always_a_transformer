Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is a digit (0 or 1), that's our answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nInput: w0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i0w0r0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1w0r0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0w1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i1i0r1i1i0i0i0i0w0i0i0w0w0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i0r0i1i0i0w1i0r1i1w1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1w1w1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r1i1w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r\n\nStarting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find the last 'w' which is part of \"i1w0\". The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w': The last occurrence of 'w' is towards the end of the string.\n2. Look at the character after the rightmost 'w': After finding the last 'w', we see the character that follows it.\n\nUpon examining the string, the rightmost 'w' is followed by a '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
