Print the digit.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input string:\n\nInput: w1r1i0i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i1i0i0r1w0i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i0w0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r0w1i0i0i0i1i0w1i0i1r1i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0r0i0r0i0r0i1i1w0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1w0r0i0i0i1r0i0r0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1w0r0i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1w1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w1...\". The character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
