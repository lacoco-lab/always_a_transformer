If it is, update `last_w_index` with the current index.\n3. After iterating over the entire string, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the last 'w'.\n4. Check if `last_w_index` is not -1 (meaning 'w' was found at least once) and if it's not the last character in the string.\n5. If both conditions are met, return the character at `last_w_index + 1`, which is the digit after the last 'w'.\n\n", "input_length": 634, "output_length": 224, "tokenized_output": ["<", "ans", ">", "1", "</", "ans", ">\n\n", "To", " find", " the", " digit", " after", " the", " last", " '", "w", "'", " character", ",", " we", " need", " to", " iterate", " over", " the", " input", " string", " from", " left", " to", " right", " and", " keep", " track", " of", " the", " last", " occurrence", " of", " '", "w", "'.", " Once", " we", " find", " the", " last", " '", "w", "',", " we", " can", " then", " find", " the", " digit", " immediately", " after", " it", ".\n\n", "Here", "'s", " a", " step", "-by", "-step", " approach", ":\n", "1", ".", " Initialize", " a", " variable", " `", "last", "_w", "_index", "`", " to", " -", "1", ",", " which", " will", " store", " the", " index", " of", " the", " last", " '", "w", "'", " found", " in", " the", " string", ".\n", "2", ".", " Iterate", " over", " the", " input", " string", ".", " For", " each", " character", ",", " check", " if", " it", "'s", " '", "w", "'.", " If", " it", " is", ",", " update", " `", "last", "_w", "_index", "`", " with", " the", " current", " index", ".\n", "3", ".", " After", " iterating", " over", " the", " entire", " string", ",", " `", "last", "_w", "_index", "`", " will", " hold", " the", " index", " of", " the", " last", " '", "w", "'.\n", "4", ".", " Check", " if", " `", "last", "_w", "_index", "`", " is", " not", " -", "1", " (", "meaning", " '", "w", "'", " was", " found", " at", " least", " once", ")", " and", " if", " it", "'s", " not", " the", " last", " character", " in", " the", " string", ".\n", "5", ".", " If", " both", " conditions", " are", " met", ",", " return", " the", " character", " at", " `", "last", "_w", "_index", " +", " ", "1", "`,", " which", " is", " the", " digit", " after", " the", " last", " '", "w", "'.\n\n", "THE", "_END"]}

If it is, update `last_w_index` with the current index.\n3. After iterating over the entire string, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the last 'w'. \n4. Check if `last_w_index` is not -1 (meaning 'w' was found at least once) and if it's not the last character in the string.\n5.

Once we find the last 'w', we can then look at the character immediately after it. \n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n1. Initialize a variable `last_w_index` to -1, which will store the index of the last 'w' found in the string.\n2. Iterate over the input string. For each character, check if it's 'w'. If it is, update `last_w_index` with the current index.\n3. After iterating over the entire string, `last_w_index` will hold the index of the last 'w'. \n4. Check if `last_w_index` is not -1 (meaning 'w' was found at least once) and if it's not the last character in the string.\n5.
