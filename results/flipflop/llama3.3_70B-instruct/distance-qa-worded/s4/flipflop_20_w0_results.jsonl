Look at the character immediately after 'write'.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\nThe input string is: write0ignore0read0read0read0read0ignore0ignore1read0read\n\nStarting from the end and moving backwards, we find 'write' for the last time as 'write0' near the beginning of the string, but since we are looking for the rightmost 'write', we continue searching. The next 'write' from the right is not found because 'write0' is the only 'write' in the string.\n\nHowever, upon re-examining the task, it seems the approach should involve finding the last 'write' and then looking at the digit immediately following it. Given the string structure, the last 'write' is indeed 'write0', and the digit immediately after it is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'write' instruction is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
