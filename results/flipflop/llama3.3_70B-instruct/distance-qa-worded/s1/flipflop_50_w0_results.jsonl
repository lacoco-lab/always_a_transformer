Given this, if we consider 'write' as the starting point and look for the pattern that follows the last clear instruction before the string ends, which seems to be a series of 'read's, we realize the task might be misunderstood due to the structure of the input string.\n\nHowever, following the literal interpretation and the steps outlined for a general approach to such a problem, and considering the input might be structured differently than described, let's correct the course based on the actual task:\n\nGiven the input string starts with 'write' and the question asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'write' instruction, but the string provided does not explicitly repeat 'write', the question seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the input structure. \n\nIf we were to find a 'write' instruction followed by a digit in a structured format, we would look for the sequence 'write' followed by either '0' or '1'. In the provided string, 'write' is followed by '1' at the beginning. Without a clear repetition of 'write' to determine a \"rightmost\" instance in the conventional sense, the initial 'write' followed by '1' is the only clear instance of 'write' being followed by a digit.\n\nThus, based on the information given and the structure of the task, the answer would reflect the digit following the initial 'write', which is '1'. \n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
