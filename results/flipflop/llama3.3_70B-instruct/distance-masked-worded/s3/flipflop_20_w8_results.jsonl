This involves scanning the string from right to left until we find the first occurrence of 'write'.\n\nLet's perform the steps:\n\n1. Scanning from right to left, the rightmost 'write' is found at the position before \"0read0ignore1read0read0read\", which means the 'write' instruction we are interested in is \"write0\".\n\n2. The digit immediately after this 'write' instruction is '0'.\n\n3.
