Find the rightmost 'w' character in the string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after this 'w' character.\n3. Replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\nInput string: w1r1w0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1w1r\n\n1. **Find the rightmost 'w'**: The string is scanned from right to left to find the last occurrence of 'w'. The rightmost 'w' is found at the position before '1r' at the end of the string.\n\n2. **Identify the digit after 'w'**: The digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n3. **Mask the digit**: Replace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is: w1r1w0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1w<masked_digit>r\n\nNow, I will put the masked sequence between '<sequence_start>' and '<sequence_end>"}
