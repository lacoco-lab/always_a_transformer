The correct approach involves systematically searching for the last occurrence of 'w' and then masking the digit that immediately follows it.\n\nGiven the input string:\nw1i1w1i1i1r1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1r0i1i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i0w1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1w0i0r0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1w1r1i1i1r1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1w1i1i0i1i1w1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r1r\n\nThe last 'w' is actually in the sequence: ...i1i1w1i1w1i1i0i1i1w1...\n\nSo, the correct masking should occur after the last 'w' in: ...i1i1w1...\n\nThus, the correct output after masking the digit following the rightmost 'w' is:\n<sequence_start>w1i1w1i1i1r1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1r0i1i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i0w1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1w0i0r0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1w1r1i1i1r1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1w1i1i0i1i1w1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r1r</sequence_end>\n\nHowever, the accurate masking requires identifying the last 'w' and replacing the digit immediately after it with <masked_digit>. Given the correct identification of the last 'w' as being part of the sequence ...i1i1w1..., the digit '1' immediately after the 'w' should be replaced.\n\nCorrect Masking:\nThe input string with the correct masking applied is:\nw1i1w1i1i1r1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1r0i1i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i0w1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1w0i0r0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1w1r1i1i1r1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1w1i1i0i1i1w1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r1r\n\nGiven the last 'w' is in ...i1i1w1..., the correct masking should result in:\n...i1i1w<masked_digit>i1w1i1i0i1i1w1...\n\nThus, the final masked sequence, considering the correction in identifying the rightmost 'w' and applying the mask, is:\n<sequence_start>w1i1w1i1i1r1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1r0i1i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i0w1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1w0i0r0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1w1r1i1i1r1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1w1i1i0i1i1w1i0i1i0i<sequence_end>"}
