Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\nInput string: w1r1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1w0i1r0r0w0i1i1i0w0r0i0w0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0w1r1i0i0i0i0i1i0w0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r\n\nStep 1: Find the rightmost 'w' character.\nThe rightmost 'w' character is at the end of the string: ...i0i1i0r, the last 'w' is in 'w0'.\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\nThe digit after 'w0' is not present as 'w0' is at the end, but 'w0' itself has a '0' after 'w'. However, considering the task, we look for the 'w' that has a digit after it, which leads us to the second last 'w': 'w1'. The digit after 'w1' is '1' but since we are looking for the rightmost 'w' that has a digit after it and is not at the end, we consider 'w1' in 'w1r1...'. The digit after this 'w1' is indeed '1'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\nReplace '1' with <masked_digit> in 'w1r1...'.\n\nThe modified string is: w<masked_digit>r1i0i0i0i0i1i0w0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r\n\nHowever, the correct approach should identify the last 'w' followed by a digit, which is indeed 'w1' in this context, and mask the '1'. The correct masking should occur at the position of the last 'w' that is followed by a digit, which is 'w1'. The correct sequence to mask is the '1' after the 'w' in 'w1', resulting in 'w<masked_digit>...'.\n\nGiven the misunderstanding in the explanation, let's correct the process and directly provide the masked sequence as per the task:\n\n<sequence_start>w1r1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1w0i1r0r0w0i1i1i0w0r0i0w0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0w<masked_digit>r1i0i0i0i0i1i0w0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r<sequence_end>"}
