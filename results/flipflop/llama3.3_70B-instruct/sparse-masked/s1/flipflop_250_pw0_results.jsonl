Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after this 'w' character.\n3. Replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the algorithmic solution:\n\nInput string: w0i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1w1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r1i0r1w0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i1w1i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r\n\nFirst, we find the rightmost 'w' in the string. After examining the string, we find that the last 'w' is at the very end of the string: ...i1i1w1...\n\nNow, we identify the digit after this 'w'. Since 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it. However, the task asks us to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', implying we should look for the 'w' that has a digit following it. Let's re-examine the string for the rightmost 'w' that is not at the end of the string and has a digit after it.\n\nUpon re-examination, we find another 'w' that is followed by a digit: ...w0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i1w1... and ...w0i1i0i0r0... Here, the 'w' is followed by '0', which is the digit we need to mask.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is 'w' followed by '1' in ...i1i1w1... No, 'w1' is the last 'w' and '1' is the digit after it.\n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that has a digit after it is '1'. We will replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1w1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r1i0r1w0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i1w1i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r<masked_digit>i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r1i0r1w0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i1w<masked_digit>i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r</sequence_end>\n\nHowever, the above solution does not follow the instructions correctly because it does not properly identify the last 'w' followed by a digit and mask the digit. \n\nLet's correct the approach by properly identifying the last occurrence of 'w' that is followed by a digit and then mask that digit.\n\nThe correct approach involves scanning the string from right to left to find the first 'w' that is followed by a digit, and then mask that digit.\n\nUpon scanning the string from right to left, we find that the last 'w' followed by a digit is indeed 'w1' at the end of the string: ...i1i1w1. Here, '1' is the digit after 'w'.\n\nSo, the correct masking should replace the '1' after the last 'w' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the corrected string:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1w1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r1i0r1w0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i1w1i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r1i0r1w0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i1w<masked_digit></sequence_end>\n\nThis solution still does not correctly follow the instructions because it does not properly mask the digit after the last 'w' that is followed by a digit.\n\nLet's correct this by properly masking the digit after the last 'w':\n\nThe last 'w' in the string is 'w', and it is followed by '1'.
