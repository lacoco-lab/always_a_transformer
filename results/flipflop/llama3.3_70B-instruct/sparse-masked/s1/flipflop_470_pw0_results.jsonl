After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1i0i1i0i1i1w0i1r.\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. However, since 'w' is at the end of the string in this case, there is no digit after it to mask. But, considering the instruction to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and given the 'w' is followed by '0i1r', the digit after 'w' in this context is indeed '0'. \n\nSo, the correct action is to mask the '0' that comes after the 'w' in the sequence ...w0i1r, resulting in ...w<masked_digit>i1r.\n\nHere is the masked sequence:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i1r0i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0w0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i0i0i0i1i0r0r0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0r0r0i1i1i1i0r0r0r0i1i0w1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1w1i0r1r1r1i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r1r1i1i1w0i1i1w0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1w0i1w0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1r0w0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0w0r0r0i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i0w1i1i1r1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1w1r1w1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i0i1i1w<masked_digit>i1r<sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, but since there are multiple 'w's at the end, I will consider the last 'w' that is not followed by another 'w'. However, given the instruction, I should look for the last 'w' that has a digit after it. The last 'w' with a digit after it is 'w1' near the end of the string.\n\nThe digit after the rightmost 'w' with a following digit is '1'. \n\nNow, I replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw1i0r1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0r1r1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1w1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i0i1w0i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1w1i1i1i1i1i1w1r1i1i1i0i1w1i1i0i1i1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0r1r1i0i0w1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0r1w1i1i1i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i1w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i0r1r1r1w1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0w0i0w0i0i0r0i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i0r0r0w0i0i1i1r\n\nHowever, the correct approach should involve finding the last 'w' followed by a digit and then masking that digit. Given the complexity and the need for precision in following the instructions, let's re-evaluate the string to ensure accuracy in identifying the rightmost 'w' followed by a digit and then mask the digit correctly.\n\nUpon re-evaluation, considering the instruction to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', the focus should be on the last occurrence of 'w' that is directly followed by a digit. The string provided is complex, and the task requires a precise identification of the last 'w' followed by a digit to mask that digit correctly.\n\nGiven the string and the task, the correct masking should occur at the position where the last 'w' is followed by a digit. The instruction implies a direct replacement of the digit immediately following the last 'w' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the corrected approach to solve the task:\n\n1.

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, but since there are multiple 'w's at the end, I will consider the last 'w' that is not followed by another 'w'. However, given the instruction, I should look for the last 'w' that has a digit after it. The last 'w' with a digit after it is 'w1' near the end of the string.\n\nThe digit after the rightmost 'w' with a following digit is '1'. \n\nNow, I replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw1i0r1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0r1r1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1w1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i0i1w0i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1w1i1i1i1i1i1w1r1i1i1i0i1w1i1i0i1i1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0r1r1i0i0w1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1r1i0r1w1i1i1i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i1w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i0r1r1r1w1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0w0i0w0i0i0r0i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i0r0r0w0i0i1i1r\n\nHowever, the correct approach should involve finding the last 'w' followed by a digit and then masking that digit. Given the complexity and the need for precision in following the instructions, let's re-evaluate the string to ensure accuracy in identifying the rightmost 'w' followed by a digit and then mask the digit correctly.\n\nUpon re-evaluation, considering the instruction to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', the focus should be on the last occurrence of 'w' that is directly followed by a digit. The string provided is complex, and the task requires a precise identification of the last 'w' followed by a digit to mask that digit correctly.\n\nGiven the string and the task, the correct masking should occur at the position where the last 'w' is followed by a digit. The instruction implies a direct replacement of the digit immediately following the last 'w' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the corrected approach to solve the task:\n\n1.
