However, the task requires masking the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Given the 'w' is at the end, the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there is no digit after the last 'w' to mask. \n\nHowever, to follow the instructions to the letter as requested and given the nature of the task, the correct interpretation would be to identify the last 'w' and then determine if there's a digit after it. Since there isn't, the task technically cannot be completed as intended. But to provide a response in the requested format, I will proceed under the assumption that the task is to identify the sequence up to the point where the masking would occur, even though the specific action of masking a digit after the last 'w' cannot be performed.\n\nGiven the input and the steps, the sequence to consider for masking would end at the last 'w'. However, since the task involves masking a digit after a 'w' and the last 'w' is at the end of the string, there's no digit to mask. The sequence provided does not allow for the masking of a digit after the rightmost 'w' as there is no digit following it.\n\nTo adhere to the format requested for the output:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i1w1i1i0i1w1r1i1i0i0i0r1w1i0i1r1i0i0r1i1i0i0w1i1i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r1i1w0i1r0i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0w0i0i1i1i1w0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i1w0r0i1w1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0w1w1i1w1w1i1i0i0i1i0r1w0i1r0i0i1w0w0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i0w0r0i0i0w1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1w0r0i1i0i0r0w1i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i0w0i1i1r0i0w0r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i1i0r</sequence_start>\n\n<sequence_end>", "flipflop": "w1i1w1i1i0i1w1r1i1i0i0i0r1w1i0i1r1i0i0r1i1i0i0w1i1i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r1i1w0i1r0i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0w0i0i1i1i1w0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i1w0r0i1w1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0w1w1i1w1w1i1i0i0i1i0r1w0i1r0i0i1w0w0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i0w0r0i0i0w1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1w0r0i1i0i0r0w1i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i0w0i1i1r0i0w0r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i1i0r1", "last_valid_token": 1, "last_write_index": 472, "full_answer": "To solve this task, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.

However, the task requires masking the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Given the 'w' is at the end, the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there is no digit after the last 'w' to mask. \n\nHowever, to follow the instructions to the letter as requested and given the nature of the task, the correct interpretation would be to identify the last 'w' and then determine if there's a digit after it. Since there isn't, the task technically cannot be completed as intended. But to provide a response in the requested format, I will proceed under the assumption that the task is to identify the sequence up to the point where the masking would occur, even though the specific action of masking a digit after the last 'w' cannot be performed.\n\nGiven the input and the steps, the sequence to consider for masking would end at the last 'w'. However, since the task involves masking a digit after a 'w' and the last 'w' is at the end of the string, there's no digit to mask. The sequence provided does not allow for the masking of a digit after the rightmost 'w' as there is no digit following it.\n\nTo adhere to the format requested for the output:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i1w1i1i0i1w1r1i1i0i0i0r1w1i0i1r1i0i0r1i1i0i0w1i1i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r1i1w0i1r0i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0w0i0i1i1i1w0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i1w0r0i1w1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0w1w1i1w1w1i1i0i0i1i0r1w0i1r0i0i1w0w0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i0w0r0i0i0w1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1w0r0i1i0i0r0w1i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i0w0i1i1r0i0w0r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i1i0r</sequence_start>\n\n<sequence_end>"}

The last 'w' is actually before a series of 'i's and 'r's and 'w's are also present before these 'i's and 'r's. The correct rightmost 'w' is: ...i1i1i1i0w1i0r1r1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0w1...

The rightmost 'w' is actually ...w1i1i0i0i0i0w1... and the very last 'w' is ...i1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1r1i1i0r1i1w0... No, the very last 'w' is actually ...w0r0i1r0i1i0i1i1i1i0w0...

Thus, the digit to be masked is '1', which is immediately after the last 'w'.\n\nThe corrected masked sequence, with the digit after the rightmost 'w' replaced with '<masked_digit>', is:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i0i1r1r1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0w0i0i1i1r0w0i1i0i0r0i1i1<sequence_end>"}
