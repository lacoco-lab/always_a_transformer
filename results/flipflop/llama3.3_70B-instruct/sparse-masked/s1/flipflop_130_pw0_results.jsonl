Find the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1i1i1i0i1r. The last 'w' is actually 'w0' which is before 'i1i1i1i0i1r'. So the rightmost 'w' is 'w0'.\n\n2. Identify the digit after the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe digit after 'w0' is 'i' which is not a digit, but the next character '1' is a digit. However, according to the task, we need to mask the digit immediately after 'w', and 'i' is not a digit. But since 'i' is not a digit, we look for the next digit which is '1'. But to follow the task to the letter, we should consider 'i' as the character immediately after 'w', and since it's not a digit, the task's condition is not met in a straightforward manner. However, given the task's intent seems to be about masking a digit, and 'i' is not a digit but the next '1' is, a strict interpretation would require us to look for a digit immediately after 'w', which is not present. The task, however, implies an action on a digit, suggesting a potential misunderstanding in the task's description regarding non-digit characters immediately following 'w'. \n\nGiven the task's apparent intent and the format provided, if we were to mask a digit following 'w' directly or indirectly, we'd look for the next digit, which is '1'. However, strictly speaking, the task as described does not directly apply because 'i' is not a digit.\n\n3. Since the task specifically asks to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and given the confusion around 'i' not being a digit, a literal interpretation of the task would not apply directly because there's no digit immediately after 'w0'. But to provide a meaningful response based on the task's apparent intent (masking a digit related to the rightmost 'w'), and considering the format and expectation:\n\nIf we were to adjust our understanding to the next available digit for the sake of providing a response that fits the expected format (though not strictly adhering to the task as 'i' is not a digit), the sequence with the next available digit masked (which is not directly after 'w' due to 'i') would be misleading. The correct approach, following the task to the letter as requested, would actually be to state that there's no digit immediately after 'w' to mask, based on the provided input and instructions.\n\nHowever, to fulfill the request in the spirit of the task and provide a response that fits the format, acknowledging the misunderstanding:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is followed by '0', then 'i', then '1'. If we consider the intent might be to mask a digit in proximity, the first digit after 'w0' and 'i' is '1'. \n\nThus, if masking the first digit after 'w0' and the non-digit 'i', the sequence would be:\n<sequence_start>w1i1i1i1i0i0r1r1r1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i0r1i1r1w1r1i0w0r0r0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0w0i1<masked_digit>i1i0i1r<sequence_end>"}
