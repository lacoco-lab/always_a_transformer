After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"...i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r\".\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that I need to find the last occurrence of 'w' that is not at the very end of the string and is followed by a digit. The last 'w' followed by a digit is \"...w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i0w1...\". Here, the 'w' is followed by '1', which is the digit to be masked.\n\nNow, I replace the '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1i1w1i0r1r1i1i0i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i1w1w1w1i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i0i1i1i0w1i1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i1i1r1i0i1w0i1r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1w1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r becomes \nw0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1i1w1i0r1r1i1i0i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i1w1w1w1i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i0i1i1i0w1i1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i1i1r1i0i1w0i1r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1w1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is actually at the position \"...i0i0r\" which is not followed by any digit.

Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1w1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0r0w1i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i1i0w0w0i1i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r1i1r1i0i0i0i0w0w0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0w1w1i0i0r1w0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1w0r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0w1i1i0w1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r\n\nFirst, I find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w1w1i0i0r1w0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1w0r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0w1i1i0w1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r\" and it is the 'w' in \"w1\".\n\nNext, I identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character, which is '1'.\n\nNow, I replace the identified digit '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string is:\nw0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1w1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0r0w1i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i1i0w0w0i1i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r1i1r1i0i0i0i0w0w0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0w1w1i0i0r1w0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1w0r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0w1i1i0w1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r becomes \nw0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1w1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0r0w1i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i1i0w0w0i1i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r1i1r1i0i0i0i0w0w0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0w1w1i0i0r1w0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1w0r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0w1i1i0w1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r \nreplaced with \nw0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1w1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0r0w1i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i1i0w0w0i1i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r1i1r1i0i0i0i0w0w0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0w1w1i0i0r1w0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1w0r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1<sequence_end>"}
