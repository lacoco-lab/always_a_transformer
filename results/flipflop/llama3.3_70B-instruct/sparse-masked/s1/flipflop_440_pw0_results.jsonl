After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1r1i1w1r\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. However, since 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it to mask.\n\nBut since the task is to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and there is no digit after the last 'w', the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there's no digit to mask. However, to follow the instructions as closely as possible and to provide a response that fits the requested format, I will proceed under the assumption that the task is to identify the rightmost 'w' and then handle the absence of a following digit.\n\nGiven the input string and the task, the rightmost 'w' is indeed at the end, followed by '1r', not just a digit. The actual last 'w' is before '1r', so the digit after the last 'w' is '1'. \n\nThus, the correct approach is to find the last 'w' that is not at the end of the string and mask the digit after it. The last 'w' not at the end is before '0i0i0w0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i0r0i1i1i1w1r1i0r1i0i1r1i1w1r', which is 'w1r'. The digit after this 'w' is '1'.\n\nSo, the sequence with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (that is not at the very end of the string) masked is the original string with '1' replaced by '<masked_digit>' after the last 'w' that is not at the end of the string.\n\nHere is the corrected sequence with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (not at the end) masked:\n<sequence_start>w0r0i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i1w0i1i1r0i0r0i0r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i0i1i0i1w1i0w1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0w0i0i0i1i0r0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0r0r0i1i1i1i1i1w0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1w1i1r1r1i0i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1w1i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1w0r0i1w1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r1i0w0i0i0w0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i0r0i1i1i1w<masked_digit>r1i0r1i0i1r1i1w1r<sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0i1i1i0r.\n\nNext, I identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character. Since the 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it. However, I will look for the last 'w' that has a digit after it.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, I find that the last 'w' with a digit after it is: ...i1i1w1w1... and ...i1w1i1... and ...w1i1r1... and ...w0i1r0... and ...w1i1r1... and ...w1i0i0r1... \n\nThe rightmost 'w' with a digit after it is: ...w1i1... and the digit after it is '1' and also ...w0i1... and the digit after it is '1'.\n\nHowever, the rightmost 'w' with a digit after it is indeed ...w0i1... and also ...w1i1... . Both have the same distance to the end of the string when considering the last 'w' before the last 'i's and 'r's and '0's and '1's. \n\nHowever, the last 'w' before the last sequence of 'i's and 'r's and '0's and '1's is indeed ...w0i1... .\n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. \n\nNow, I replace the '1' with '<masked_digit>': \nThe modified string is: w0i1i0w0i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0r0i0r0i1i1w1r1i1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i0r1w1i1i1i0i1i1i0w1i0i0r1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1r1i1w1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1w1w1i1i1w1i0r1i1i0i0i0w0i1r0i1w1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i0i0w1i1r1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i0i0i0r1i1w0w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1i1w0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i1w0i0i1i1i1r0i1i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0r becomes \nw0i1i0w0i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0r0i0r0i1i1w1r1i1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i0r1w1i1i1i0i1i1i0w1i0i0r1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1r1i1w1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1w1w1i1i1w1i0r1i1i0i0i0w0<masked_digit>r0i1w1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i0i0w1i1r1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i0i0i0r1i1w0w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1i1w0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i1w0i0i1i1i1r0i1i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0r\n\nNow, I will put the modified string between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}

Upon finding it, we identify the next character as the digit to be masked.\n\nAfter performing the steps, the masked sequence is obtained by replacing the digit after the rightmost 'w' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the result:\n\n<sequence_start>w0r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1w0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i0w0r0i1i0i0i1r0i1w1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0r1i1w1w1i1i1i1i1i0w1r1i0i0i0i1i0w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r0w1r1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0w1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i1r1i0i0r1i0i1w1w1i0i0r1r1i1r1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0w1i0w1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i1r1w<masked_digit>i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i1r1i0i0r1i0i1w1w1i0i0r1r1i1r1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0w1i0w1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1i1r1r<sequence_end>"}
