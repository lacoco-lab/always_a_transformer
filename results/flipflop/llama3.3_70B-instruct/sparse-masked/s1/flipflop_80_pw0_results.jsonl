Identifying the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - After finding the rightmost 'w', we look at the character immediately to its right.\n   - This character is the one that needs to be masked.\n\nLet's perform these steps on the given string:\n\nThe input string is: w0r0r0i0i0i1w1i1i1i1r1i0w0i0i0r0i0r0r0i0i0i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i0i0i0r\n\nScanning from right to left, the rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string: ...1w1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i0i0i0r\n\nThe digit immediately after this 'w' is '1'.\n\nNow, we replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw0r0r0i0i0i1w1i1i1i1r1i0w0i0i0r0i0r0r0i0i0i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i0i0i0r becomes\nw0r0r0i0i0i1w1i1i1i1r1i0w0i0i0r0i0r0r0i0i0i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i<masked_digit>i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i0i0i0r\n\nHere is the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
