Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw1r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i1i0i1i0w0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w1r1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1w1r1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i0r0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i0r\n\nNow, let's find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0i0w0...\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. However, since it's at the end of the string, there's no digit to mask in this case, but to follow the instructions precisely and given the nature of the task, the correct interpretation is to mask the '0' that immediately follows the last 'w', even though it's the last character.\n\nThus, the masked sequence, following the instructions to the letter and considering the specific request, would be the entire string with the last '0' masked, since it directly follows the last 'w'. The correct masking, according to the task's requirements, would result in:\n\n<sequence_start>w1r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i1i0i1i0w0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w1r1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1w1r1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i0r0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i0r<masked_digit></sequence_end>\n\nHowever, given the specific nature of the task and the requirement to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and considering the 'w' is followed directly by a '0' which is the last character, the accurate interpretation leads to masking this '0'. The correct output, following the precise instructions and the specific scenario provided, should indeed reflect the masking of the digit immediately after the last 'w', which is the '0' at the end. \n\nTherefore, the final masked sequence, with the last character being the digit after the rightmost 'w' and thus needing to be masked, is correctly represented as the entire string with the adjustment made to the last character to reflect the masking instruction accurately. \n\nGiven this, the final answer, with proper masking applied according to the task's specific requirements and the unique scenario of the input string, is:\n\n<sequence_start>w1r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i1i0i1i0w0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w1r1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1w1r1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i0r0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i0r<masked_digit></sequence_end><sequence_end>"}

Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the input string: w0i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i1w0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0w0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i0i0i1w1w1r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0r0i0i0r0i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1r0i1i1w1r1i0i0i1w1i0w1i1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0w0r\n\nNow, let's find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, and it is followed by the character 'r', but since 'r' is not a digit, we look at the last 'w' that is followed by a digit. \n\nUpon re-examining the string, I found the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is actually \"w1\" which appears multiple times. The very last occurrence of \"w1\" is what we are interested in.\n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is '1'. \n\nNow, let's replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is: \nw0i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i1w0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0w0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i0i0i1w1w1r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0r0i0i0r0i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1r0i1i1w1r1i0i0i1w1i0w1i1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0w0r becomes \nw0i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i1w0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0w0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i0i0i1w1w1r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0r0i0i0r0i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1r0i1i1w1r1i0i0i1w1i0w1i1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0w0r is modified to \nw0i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i1w0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0w0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i0i0i1w1w1r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0r0i0i0r0i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1r0i1i1w1r1i0i0i1w1i0w1i1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0w0r is modified to \nw0i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i1w0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0w0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i0i0i1w1w1r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0r0i0i0r0i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1r0i1i1w1r1i0i0i1w1i0w1i1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0w0r becomes \nw0i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i1w0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0w0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i0i0i1w1w1r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0r0i0i0r0i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1r0i1i1w1r1i0i0i1w1i0w1i1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0w0r is modified to \nw0i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i1w0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w0i<sequence_end>"}

(No, this 'w' is not the last one with a digit after it)\nThe correct 'w' is: ...i0i1i0i1i1i1w0...\n\nThe correct 'w' is at: ...i0i1i0i1i1i1w0...\n\nThe digit after this 'w' is '0'. \n\nNow, let's replace this '0' with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the modified string:\n<sequence_start>w0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w0i1i0i0r0i1i1r0i1i0r0i0w0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r0i1w0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i1w1r1i1i1i1i1i1i0w0i1r0i0i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i0w1i0r1i1i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i0i0r1r1i1r1i0w0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1i1i0r1i1i0i1i1i1i1w<masked_digit>i1i0i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1i1i0r<sequence_end>"}
