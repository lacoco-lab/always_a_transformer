Find the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe rightmost 'w' character is at the end of the string: ...i1w0i1i0i1r\n\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character is '0'.\n\n3. Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag:\nReplace '0' with <masked_digit>: ...i1w<masked_digit>i0i1r\n\nNow, I will print the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
