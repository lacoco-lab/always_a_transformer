Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\n\nHere is the algorithmic solution:\n\nInput string: w0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i0r0i1w0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i1w0i0i1i1r0w1i1i1i0i0r1i0i1r1w1r1w1i1i1i1i1i1i1r1i1r1r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w1i0r1i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i0w0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i0w1w1w1r1i0i1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1i1i0r\n\nStep 1: Find the rightmost 'w' character.\nThe rightmost 'w' character is at the end of the string: ...i1i0r1i1i0r\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\nSince the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it. However, looking at the string, the last 'w' is actually part of 'w1' which means the digit after the last 'w' is '1'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\nReplace '1' with '<masked_digit>' in 'w1': w<masked_digit>\n\nNow, let's replace 'w1' with 'w<masked_digit>' in the original string:\nw0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i0r0i1w0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i1w0i0i1i1r0w1i1i1i0i0r1i0i1r1w1r1w1i1i1i1i1i1i1r1i1r1r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w1i0r1i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i0w0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i0w1w1w1r1i0i1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1i1i0r becomes\nw0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i0r0i1w0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i1w0i0i1i1r0w1i1i1i0i0r1i0i1r1w1r1w1i1i1i1i1i1i1r1i1r1r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w1i0r1i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i0w0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i0w1w1w1r1i0i1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1i1i0r is incorrect since we need to find the last 'w' and mask the digit after it.

However, this means the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there is no digit to mask after the last 'w'. \n\nGiven the instruction to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and since there is no digit after the last 'w', the sequence remains unchanged in terms of masking a digit. However, to follow the instruction to the letter as requested and to indicate that the task has been considered, I will provide the original string as it is, wrapped in the requested tags, without any modifications since the condition for masking (a digit after the rightmost 'w') is not met.\n\n<sequence_start>w1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0w0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0w1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1r1w1i0i1i1i1r1i0w0i0i1i0i1r0r0i0i1i1i0i1w0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w0i1i0r0i1i0i1w1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1w1i1i0i0i1r<sequence_end>"}
