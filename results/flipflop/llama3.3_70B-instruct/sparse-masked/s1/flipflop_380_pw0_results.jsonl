After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string: ...i0i1i0i1r\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is the last character in the string, and the digit after it does not exist because 'w' is the last character. However, according to the task, I need to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Since there is no digit after the last 'w', I will consider the task as requesting to mask the digit that would be after the last 'w' if it existed. But since the task specifically asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w' and there isn't one, the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there's no digit to mask.\n\nHowever, to follow the instructions to the letter as requested and given the nature of the task, I must point out the misunderstanding in the task's requirement due to the input string's structure. Given the input string ends with 'i0i1i0i1r', the last 'w' is actually not at the end but rather before the last sequence of characters. The correct approach is to find the last 'w' and then mask the digit after it.\n\nUpon re-examining the string for the rightmost 'w' that is not at the end, I find: ...w1i1i0i0i1i0i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is 'w1'. The digit after this 'w' is '1'. I will replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw1i1i1i1i0r1r1i1i0i0r1i1i0w1i1i1r1i0w0i0i0i1i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0w1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i1r1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r1w<masked_digit>i0w1r1r1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r1r1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0w0r0i0i1i0i0r0r0i1i0w1i0i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1w1i0r1i1i0r1i0r1i0i1w1i1i0i0i1i0i1r\n\nHere is the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0w1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1w1w1i1i1i0r1i1i1i1w0i0r\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. However, in this case, there are multiple 'w's at the end, and the task is to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w'.

But since the rightmost 'w' is in \"w1w1\", the digit after the second to last 'w' is '1'. \n\nHowever, upon re-reading the task, I realize I should mask the digit after the rightmost 'w' if it exists. Since there is no digit after the rightmost 'w', I should look for the last 'w' that has a digit after it and mask that digit.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, I find that the last 'w' with a digit after it is in the sequence \"w1\". The digit after this 'w' is '1'. \n\nSo, I will replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' that has a digit after it masked:\n<sequence_start>w0w0i0w0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0w1i1i1i1i0w1i0r1i0i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1i0i0i0w1i1r1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r1i0w0r0i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0w0i0i0w0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0i0i0w1w1i0r1i0i0i1r1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1r1i1i0i0i1r</sequence_end> is incorrect because I did not mask the digit.\n\nLet me re-do the task.\n\nThe last 'w' with a digit after it is \"w1\" in \"w1w1\".

After scanning the string from right to left, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0r1i0r1i0r.\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. However, since the 'w' is at the very end, there is no digit after it to mask.\n\nGiven the instruction and the input, the task as described cannot be completed because there is no digit after the rightmost 'w' to mask. However, to follow the instruction to the letter as requested and provide a response in the specified format, I will include the original string as it is, since no modification can be made according to the task's criteria:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i1w1i0i1i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i0w1w1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0w1i1i0w1w1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i1r1i1w0i1i1i1i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i0i1r0i1r0i1w1i0i0i1i0i1w1i1i0i0i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0w1i1i0r1i0i1i1i0w1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1w0i1i0i1i1i0w0i0r0i1i1i0r0w1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r1r1i1i0i1r1i0r1i0r</sequence_end><sequence_end>"}
