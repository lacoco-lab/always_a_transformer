After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0i0r1r.\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. However, since 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it to mask.\n\nBut let's re-examine the string to find the second rightmost 'w'. The second rightmost 'w' is: ...i1i0w0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0r1r. \n\nThe digit immediately after this 'w' is '1'. \n\nSo, the masked sequence will be the input string with the '1' after the second rightmost 'w' replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\n\n<sequence_start>w1i1i0i0w1i1r1i1r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1w1i0r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i0i0r1i0i1i1w0i1i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1r0r0i1r0i1i1w1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1w1r1i1r1i0i0w0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r0r0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0i1i0w0r0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0r1r</sequence_start> is incorrect since we need to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w' which is not present, and the second rightmost 'w' has a '0' after it, not '1'. \n\nLet's correct this.\n\n\nThe correct rightmost 'w' to consider is ...i1i0w0...
