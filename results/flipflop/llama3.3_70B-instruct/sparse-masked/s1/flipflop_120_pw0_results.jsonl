Identify the digit after the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe digit immediately after 'w0' is 'i' which is not a digit, but the task asks for the digit after 'w', so we look at 'w0' and see that '0' is the digit associated with 'w' in 'w0'. However, the task's wording implies looking for a digit that follows 'w' directly in a sequence where 'w' is not part of a 'w' plus digit combination but rather 'w' followed by a digit. Given the structure of the input, 'w0' suggests 'w' followed by '0', a digit. Thus, the digit after the 'w' in 'w0' is indeed '0'.\n\n3. Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag:\nSince the digit '0' is directly after 'w' in 'w0', we replace '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw1i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r1w1i1i1i1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1w0i1i1i1w<masked_digit>i1i0i0i1i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1r0i1r0i0r0r\n\nNow, I will put the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
