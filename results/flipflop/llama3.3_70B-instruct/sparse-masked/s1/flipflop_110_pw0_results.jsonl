If it's a digit, it will be replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nLet's perform these steps on the given input string:\n\nInput: w1i0i1i0w1i1i1w1i0i1r1i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i0r1r1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string. After scanning the string, the rightmost 'w' is found, and the digit immediately after it is '1'.\n\nSo, the digit '1' after the rightmost 'w' will be replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i0i1i0w1i1i1w1<masked_digit>i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i0r1r1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0r<sequence_end>"}
