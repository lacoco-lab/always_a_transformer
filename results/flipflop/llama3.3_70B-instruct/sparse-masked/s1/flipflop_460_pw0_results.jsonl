After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w0i1i1r\".\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. \n\nNow, I will replace '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string:\nw<masked_digit>i1i1r\n\nHowever, the task requires the entire modified string to be printed, not just the part around the rightmost 'w'. To achieve this, I will replace the original 'w0' with 'w<masked_digit>' in the entire input string.\n\nHere is the modified input string with the entire sequence:\n<sequence_start>w0i0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0w0i1i1i0i0i1w0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0r0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0i0r0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0w0i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0w1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i0i0r1i1r1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0w1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1w1r1i0i0w1i0i0r1i1w0r0i0r0w0i1i0i1i0i1r0r0i0i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1w0r0i0i1r0w0i0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w0i1i1r becomes \n<sequence_start>w0i0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0w0i1i1i0i0i1w0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0r0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0i0r0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0w0i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0w1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i0i0r1i1r1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0w1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1w1r1i0i0w1i0i0r1i1w0r0i0r0w0i1i0i1i0i1r0r0i0i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1w0r0i0i1r0w0i0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w0i1i1r is replaced with \n<sequence_start>w0i0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0w0i1i1i0i0i1w0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0r0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0i0r0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0w0i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0w1r1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i0i0r1i1r1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0w1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1w1r1i0i0w1i0i0r1i1w0r0i0r0w0i1i0i1i0i1r0r0i0i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i<sequence_end>"}
