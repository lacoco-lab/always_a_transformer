Find the rightmost 'w' character in the string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after this 'w' character.\n3. Replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the algorithmic solution:\n\nInput string: w0i1i0r0r0i1w1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0w0i1r0i0w0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1r0w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1w1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1w1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r\n\n1. **Find the rightmost 'w'**: Starting from the end of the string and moving backwards, we find the last occurrence of 'w'.\n\n2. **Identify the digit after 'w'**: Once the rightmost 'w' is found, we look at the character immediately following it.\n\n3. **Mask the digit**: We replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nLet's perform these steps on the given input string:\n\nThe input string is: w0i1i0r0r0i1w1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0w0i1r0i0w0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1r0w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1w1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1w1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r\n\nFinding the rightmost 'w'... it is at the position before '1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r'.\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is followed by '1'. We will mask this '1'.\n\nThe masked sequence is therefore: w0i1i0r0r0i1w1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0w0i1r0i0w0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1r0w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1w1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1w1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1<masked_digit>i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r\n\nHere is the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
