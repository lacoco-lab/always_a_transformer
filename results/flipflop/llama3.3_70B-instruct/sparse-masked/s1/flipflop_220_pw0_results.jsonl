After examining the string, we find that the last 'w' is followed by a '0'. \n\nSo, the digit to be masked is '0', and it will be replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0w1i0i1i0i0r1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i1w1i1i0w1r1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0w0i0r0i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r</sequence_end> is incorrect because the last 'w' was not found and the digit after it was not masked.\n\nLet's re-examine the string to find the last 'w' and mask the digit after it.\n\nUpon re-examination, the correct last 'w' is found, and the digit after it is '0'. The correct masking of this digit results in:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0w1i0i1i0i0r1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i1w1i1i0w1r1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0w0i0r0i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r</sequence_end> is still incorrect.\n\nThe last 'w' in the string is actually \"w0\" at the end of the string \"i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r\"  \"w0\". \n\nSo the correct masking is:\nw0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0w1i0i1i0i0r1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i1w1i1i0w1r1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0w0i0r0i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r becomes \nw0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0w1i0i1i0i0r1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i1w1i1i0w1r1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0w0i0r0i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1w<masked_digit>i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0w1i0i1i0i0r1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i1w1i1i0w1r1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0w0i0r0i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1w<masked_digit>i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r</sequence_end><sequence_end>"}
