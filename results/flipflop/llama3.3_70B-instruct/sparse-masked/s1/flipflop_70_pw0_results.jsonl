Finding the rightmost 'w' character:\n   - The input string is scanned from right to left to find the last occurrence of 'w'.\n   - The rightmost 'w' is found at the position where 'w' appears for the last time before the end of the string.\n\n2. Identifying the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - After finding the rightmost 'w', the next character is checked.\n   - The digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n3. Masking the digit:\n   - The identified digit '0' is replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nNow, performing these steps on the given input string:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string. After this 'w', the digit is '0'. Replacing this '0' with '<masked_digit>' gives us the masked sequence.\n\nOriginal string: w0i0w0i1i1w0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r\nRightmost 'w' position and the following digit: ...w0...\nMasked sequence: w0i0w0i1i1w0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r becomes w0i0w0i1i1w<masked_digit>i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0w0i1i1w<masked_digit>i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i0r0i0r<sequence_end>"}
