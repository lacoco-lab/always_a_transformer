Since 'i' is not a digit, we look at '1', which is the digit after the sequence but to correctly identify the digit after the last 'w', we should consider '0w0w0' as the sequence and 'i1' as the following characters. The correct digit after the last 'w' in '0w0w0' is indeed '0' because '0w0w0' ends with 'w0', making '0' the digit after the 'w' in '0w0w0'. \n\nHowever, re-evaluating for clarity: The task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'.
