Find the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe rightmost 'w' character is at the end of the string: ...i1i0i1r is not correct, the correct one is ...w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i1i0i1r. The last 'w' is here: ...w0i0...\n\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character is '0'.\n\n3. Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag:\nReplace '0' with <masked_digit>.\n\nHere is the modified string:\nw0w0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r0r0i0i1i0w0i0i0w0i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0w0i1i0r0i0i1i0i0r0r0i1i1i1i1w1r1i0i1i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i1i0i1r is not correct, the correct one is \nw0w0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r0r0i0i1i0w0i0i0w0i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0w0i1i0r0i0i1i0i0r0r0i1i1i1i1w1r1i0i1i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0<masked_digit>i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i1i0i1r\n\n<sequence_start>w0w0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r0r0i0i1i0w0i0i0w0i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0w0i1i0r0i0i1i0i0r0r0i1i1i1i1w1r1i0i1i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0<masked_digit>i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i1i0i1r<sequence_end>"}
