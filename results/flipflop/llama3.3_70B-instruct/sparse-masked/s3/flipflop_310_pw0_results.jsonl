However, since '1' is followed by 'r' and not another digit, and there's no digit after the last 'w' to mask as per the initial interpretation, we need to clarify the task's intention. Given the task is to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and there's no digit after the last 'w' but rather the end of the string or a non-digit character, the task as described doesn't apply directly because there's no digit to mask after the last 'w'. \n\nHowever, following the task's instruction to the letter as requested and considering the possibility that the task implies masking the digit if it exists, and since there's no digit after the last 'w' to mask, the sequence remains unchanged in terms of masking a digit after the last 'w'. But to adhere strictly to the format requested for the answer:\n\n<sequence_start>\nw0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0w1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0w1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1w1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0w0i0i0i0i0w0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i0w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r0i1i0w1i0i1i0i1i0w1i1i0i0r1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1w1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0w1r\n<sequence_end>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw0i1i0i0i1r0i0w0w0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0r0i1w1i1i0i0i0r1i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0w1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i0i0i0w1w1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1w0i1r\n\nFirst, I find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w1w1...\". Specifically, the last 'w' is the one before the \"i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1w0i1r\" part.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is the one in \"w1\" before \"i0i0...\". The digit after this 'w' is '1'. \n\nNow, I replace this '1' with <masked_digit> to get the masked sequence.\n\nThe original string with the rightmost 'w' and the following digit identified is:\n...i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1w<digit_to_mask>...\n\nThe digit to mask is '1'. The masked sequence is the input string with '1' after the rightmost 'w' replaced with <masked_digit>.\n\nHere is the masked sequence:\n<sequence_start>w0i1i0i0i1r0i0w0w0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0r0i1w1i1i0i0i0r1i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0w1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i0i0i0w1w1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1w0<masked_digit>r<sequence_end>"}
