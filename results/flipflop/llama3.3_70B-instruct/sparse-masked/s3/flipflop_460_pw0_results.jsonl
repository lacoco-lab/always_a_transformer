After searching, we find that the last 'w' is at the position where the string ends with \"...i1i1r\".\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the actual last 'w' is found within the substring \"...i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r\" which is not the case, the correct last 'w' is actually before the last set of 'i's and 'r's and 'w's. The correct last 'w' is in the substring \"...w1i0i0i0w1i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r\".\n\nThe correct position of the last 'w' is: \"...w1i0i0i0w1i1w1...\". The 'w' before the '1' is the last 'w' in the sequence.\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\nReplace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' character masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w0i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i1r0r0r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0w0i0r0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0w0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i0i0i0w0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1w0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0r0i1w1r1i0i1i0w0i1i1i0i0w0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1w1r1i0i1w0i0i0w0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i0r0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0w1i0i0i0w1i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1r</sequence_start> is incorrect.\n\nCorrected string:\nThe last 'w' is in \"...w1i0i0i0w1i1w1...\".
