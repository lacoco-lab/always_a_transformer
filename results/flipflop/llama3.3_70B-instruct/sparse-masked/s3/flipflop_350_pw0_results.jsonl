After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0i1i0r0i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is actually the last character in the string, and there is no digit after it. However, since the task requires masking the digit after the rightmost 'w', and there are multiple 'w's in the string, I will re-examine the string to find the rightmost 'w' that has a digit after it.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' with a digit after it is: ...w1r1w... (no, this 'w' is not the rightmost), ...w0r0i1i1w... (no, this 'w' is not the rightmost), ...w0i1r0r0i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i1r0i1i1w0w0... (yes, this 'w' is the rightmost with a digit after it, but there are two 'w's here, and the last 'w' does not have a digit after it).\n\nThe rightmost 'w' with a digit after it is actually: ...r0i1i1w0... (this 'w' has a '0' after it, but there is another 'w' after this one), ...r1w0r0... (this 'w' has a '0' after it, but there is another 'w' after this one), ...r1w1r1... (this 'w' has a '1' after it).\n\nThe rightmost 'w' with a digit after it is actually: ...i1i1w0i0... (no), ...i0i1i1w0i1... (no), ...i0i0i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0r0w0r0r0... (no), ...i1i1i1r0r0i0i0r0i1i0i0r0i0w1r1...

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string.\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' does not exist because the 'w' is at the end of the string. However, since the task is to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and there is no digit after the last 'w', the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there's no digit to mask.\n\nBut to follow the instructions as closely as possible and to provide a response that fits the requested format, I will place the original string within the tags since the condition for masking (a digit after the rightmost 'w') is not met:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i1i0w1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0r1i0r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0w1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0r1i1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1w1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0w1w1r1i1i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1w0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1w1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i0w0i1r0r0i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i0i1r0i0r0i0i0r0r0w0i1i0i0r</sequence_end>\n\nNote: The task's specific condition (masking a digit after the rightmost 'w') cannot be fulfilled as intended because the rightmost 'w' is followed by the end of the string, not a digit.<sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1i1i1r0w0...\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is not present, as 'w' is at the end of the string. However, since the task requires masking the digit after the rightmost 'w', and there is no digit after the last 'w', the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there's no digit to mask. \n\nBut to follow the instructions as closely as possible and to provide a response that fits the requested format, I will place the entire input string within the <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
