The next 'w' is 'w1' and the digit after it is '1'. There are no more 'w' characters after 'w1', so the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\nReplace '1' with '<masked_digit>' in 'w1': w<masked_digit>\n\nNow, replace 'w1' with 'w<masked_digit>' in the original string:\nw1r1i1i1r1i0w0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1w1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i0i0w0r0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i1i0i0r1w0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0w1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0r1w1i0i0r1i0i1w0i1i0i0i1r0w1i1i0i0i1r1i0w1i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0r becomes\nw1r1i1i1r1i0w0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1w1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i0i0w0r0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i1i0i0r1w0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0w1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0r1w1i0i0r1i0i1w0i1i0i0i1r0w1i1i0i0i1r1i0w1i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0r is replaced with \nw1r1i1i1r1i0w0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1w1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i0i0w0r0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i1i0i0r1w0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0w1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0r1w1i0i0r1i0i1w0i1i0i0i1r0w1i1i0i0i1r1i0w1i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0r becomes \nw1r1i1i1r1i0w0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1w1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i0i0w0r0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i1i0i0r1w0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0w1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0r1w1i0i0r1i0i1w0i1i0i0i1r0w1i1i0i0i1r1i0w1i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0r is replaced with \nw1r1i1i1r1i0w0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1w1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i0i0w0r0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i1i0i0r1w0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0w1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0r1w1i0i0r1i0i1w0i1i0i0i1r0w1i1i0i0i1r1i0w1i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0r \nThe final answer is \n<sequence_start>w1r1i1i1r1i0w0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0r0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1w1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i0i0w0r0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i1i0i0<sequence_end>"}

The correct approach to mask the digit after the last 'w' in the string is as follows:\n\nGiven the input string, we find the last 'w' and then replace the next character. The correct sequence after the last 'w' is '0i0i0i0i1i1i0r'. Thus, replacing the '0' after the last 'w' with '<masked_digit>' gives us the final masked sequence.\n\nHere is the corrected approach in action:\n\nInput string: w0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0w0i0i1w0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0r0w1i0i1i1r1i0w0r0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r0w0r0i0i1i1w1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r1i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0r1w0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0w1i0i0r1i1w0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1w1i0r1i1i0i0i1i1i0w0i0w0i0i0i0i1i1i0r\n\nLast 'w' is at the position before '0i0i0i0i1i1i0r'. So, the digit to be masked is '0'.\n\nThe final masked sequence is:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0w0i0i1w0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0r0w1i0i1i1r1i0w0r0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r0w0r0i0i1i1w1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r1i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0r1w0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0w1i0i0r1i1w0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1w1i0r1i1i0i0i1i1i0w0i0w0i0i0i0i1i1i0<masked_digit>r<sequence_end>"}

This 'w' is found at the position where \"w1i1i1w1\" is located, specifically the last 'w' in \"w1i1i1w1\" is the rightmost 'w'.\n\n2. **Identify the digit after 'w'**: The digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n3. **Mask the digit**: Replace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw0i0w0i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r0w0i0i0i0w0i1i0r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i1i0i1i0i0r0w0r0i0i1i0w0r0i0i1r0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i1w0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0w1w1i1i1w<masked_digit>i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r\n\nNow, let's put the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
