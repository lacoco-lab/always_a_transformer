Masking the digit:\n   - Replace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1w0i1r0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0w1i0i0i0i0i0w<masked_digit>i0i1i0i1i0i1r\n\nNow, putting the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
