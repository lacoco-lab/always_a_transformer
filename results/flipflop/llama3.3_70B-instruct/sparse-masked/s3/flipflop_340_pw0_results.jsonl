After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, but since there are multiple 'w's at the end, I will consider the last 'w' that is not part of a sequence of 'w's at the end. However, given the instruction, I should consider the very last 'w' in the sequence of 'w's if that's what \"right most\" implies in this context. The last 'w' is indeed part of a sequence \"w0w0\" near the end.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in the sequence \"w0w0\".

After examining the string, I find that the last 'w' is at the very end of the string, but since it's at the end, there's no digit after it to mask. However, the second to last 'w' is followed by a digit. Let's correct the approach:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' that is not at the end of the string and is followed by a digit is actually \"w0\" near the end, but there are several 'w's at the end. The correct 'w' to consider is the one that is not at the very end and is followed by a digit. Upon re-examination, I see that there are multiple 'w's at the end, and the one before the last 'w' that has a digit after it is actually \"w1\" which is followed by \"i1r1r1i0i0w0w0\". However, the task is to find the rightmost 'w' that has a digit immediately after it, which upon careful examination, is \"w1\" followed by \"i1\" but before that, there's another \"w1\" followed by \"r1\". The actual rightmost 'w' followed by a digit is \"w0\" before the last sequence of 'w's and digits.\n\nHowever, the correct approach should involve finding the last 'w' that is directly followed by a digit, which requires a careful step-by-step examination from the end of the string. \n\nUpon a detailed examination from the end of the string:\n- The last 'w' is at the end, so it doesn't have a digit after it.\n- The second to last 'w' is also at the end, so it doesn't have a digit after it either.\n- Continuing this way, we find that the sequence \"w0r\" indicates the 'w' is followed by a '0', which is a digit.\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is indeed \"w0\". The digit after this 'w' is '0'. \n\nNow, I will replace this '0' with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (that is followed by a digit) masked is:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r0r0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0w0i1i1w0i1r0w0i0i1i1i0i0r0i1i0r0i1i1r0i0w0i0i0i0i1i0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0r0r0i1i0i1i0w1i1r1r1i0i0w0w0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1w1r1r1w1i1i1i0i1r1i1i0w0i0i0i0r0r0i0i1r0i1w1r1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1r1r1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0r1i0i0w<masked_digit>r<sequence_end>"}
