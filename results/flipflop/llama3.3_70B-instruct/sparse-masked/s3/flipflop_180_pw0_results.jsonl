The last 'w' is at the end of the string \"r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r\" which is not present, so we look at the string before this part: \"w0i1i0i0i1r0w1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r\". The 'w' here is \"w0\" so the digit after 'w' is '0'.\n\n- Now, we replace '0' with '<masked_digit>' in \"w0\" to get \"w<masked_digit>\".\n\n- The modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is the original string with \"w0\" replaced by \"w<masked_digit>\".\n\nHere is the modified string:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i1i1i1i0w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0w1i0i0w1i1i1w1i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i0i0i1r0w1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r</sequence_start> is incorrect because we need to replace the last \"w0\" with \"w<masked_digit>\". \n\nLet's correct that:\nThe correct string to replace is the last occurrence of \"w0\" which is in \"r0w1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r\" is not correct, the correct one is \"r0w1\" is also not correct, the correct \"w\" is in \"w0i1i0i0i1r0w1\". So the correct replacement is \"w<masked_digit>\" in \"w0\". \n\nThe correct replacement in the string is: \nw0i0i1i1i1i0w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0w1i0i0w1i1i1w1i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i0i0i1r0w1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r\n\nThe last \"w0\" is in \"r0w1\", no, the correct \"w\" is the one before the last \"w1\" which is \"w0i1i0i0i1r0w1\". So we replace \"w0\" with \"w<masked_digit>\".\n\nHere is the correct masked sequence:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i1i1i1i0w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0w1i0i0w1i1i1w1i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i0i0i1r0w1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r</sequence_start> is incorrect.\n\nLet's try again:\nThe correct string is \nw0i0i1i1i1i0w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0w1i0i0w1i1i1w1i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i0i0i1r0w1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r\n\nThe last \"w\" is in \"w0i1i0i0i1r0w1\".
