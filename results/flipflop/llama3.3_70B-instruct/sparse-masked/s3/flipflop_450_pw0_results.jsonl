However, since the task requires masking the digit after the rightmost 'w', and there is no digit after the last 'w', we should look for the second rightmost 'w' and mask the digit after it.\n\nThe second rightmost 'w' is: ...r0w1i0i0w1w1...\n\nThe digit after the second rightmost 'w' is '1'. \n\nNow, let's replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (actually the second rightmost 'w' since there is no digit after the last 'w') masked:\n<sequence_start>w1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1i0i1i1i0w0i0r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1w1i0i0i1w1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1r1w1i0i1i0i1r1i1w1i0r1i0i0w0i0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1w1r1i1i0r1i0i0i1w0r0i0i0i1i1i0w1i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w0i0i0i0r0i1i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r0w1i0i0w1w1i1i0i0w1r1i0i1i0r1r1i1i0i0w1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r1i1i0r1w0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1w0i1r0i0i1r0i1i1w1i1i1w1i1r1i1i1r1i0r0i1i1r1i0r<sequence_end>"}
