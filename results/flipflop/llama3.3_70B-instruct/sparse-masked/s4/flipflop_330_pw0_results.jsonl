After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, and it is followed by the character 'r', which means the last 'w' is actually the one before the last 'w' since 'w' is not followed by a digit in this case. However, upon closer inspection, I see that there is indeed a 'w' followed by a digit, and the very last 'w' is not followed by a digit but the second to last 'w' is indeed followed by a digit. The correct 'w' to consider is the one that is followed by '0' in 'w0r'. \n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is 'w0'. The digit after this 'w' is '0'.\n\nNow, I replace '0' with <masked_digit> to get 'w<masked_digit>r'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\nw1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0w1r1i1i1i1i1w1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0i0r1w0w0i0i0i1i1i1w0i1r0i0w0i0i0w0i1i0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i1w1i1i1i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i1w0i0i1w0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1w0i1w0r0i1i0i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i1w0r\n\nThe last 'w' followed by a digit is 'w0', so the string becomes:\nw1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0w1r1i1i1i1i1w1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0i0r1w0w0i0i0i1i1i1w0i1r0i0w0i0i0w0i1i0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i1w1i1i1i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i1w0i0i1w0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1w0i1w0r0i1i0i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i1w<masked_digit>r\n\nThe final answer is: \n<sequence_start>w1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0w1r1i1i1i1i1w1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0i0r1w0w0i0i0i1i1i1w0i1r0i0w0i0i0w0i1i0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i1w1i1i1i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i1i0i1w0i0i1w0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1w0i1w0r0i1i0i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i1w<masked_digit>r<sequence_end>"}
