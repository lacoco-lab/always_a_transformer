Find the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe rightmost 'w' character is at the end of the string: ...w1r\n\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n3. Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag:\nReplace '1' with '<masked_digit>': ...w<masked_digit>r\n\nNow, let's print the masked sequence between the '<sequence_start>' and '<sequence_end>"}
