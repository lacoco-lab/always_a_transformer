After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1r0i1r.\n\nNow, I will identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w'. However, since the 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it. But in the given string, the last 'w' is actually not at the very end but rather: ...i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1r. The last 'w' is before the last set of 'i's and the last 'r'. \n\nThe correct last 'w' is: ...w0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0w0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1r\n\nThe digit after the last 'w' is '0'. \n\nNow, I replace this '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i1i0i0i0r0i0r0i1i0i0i0i1w1i0i0i1i1i0i0w1i1i1i0i0w1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0w1r1i0i1i0i1i1w1w1i1i0i1i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0r1w0i0i1i0i1i1w0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0r0r0i0r0i1i0i0r0w1i1i0r1w0i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1w0i1i1r0i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i1i0w1i0i1r1i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r1i0r1i0i1i0i1w0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0w0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i1r is incorrect.
