Given the nature of the task, the correct masking should directly replace the digit after the last 'w' without adding characters to the end. \n\nCorrecting the approach based on the task's specifics:\nThe original string is: w1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1i0i0w1r1i1r1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r1r1r1i0w1i1i1i0i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in \"w1\" at the end of the string \"w1i0i0i0i0i1i1r\". The digit after this 'w' is '1'. Replacing '1' with '<masked_digit>' gives:\nw1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1i0i0w1r1i1r1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r1r1r1i0w1i1i1i0i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i1<masked_digit>r\n\nHowever, the accurate representation should reflect the replacement within the sequence, not an addition at the end. The correct sequence with the digit after the last 'w' masked is therefore:\nw1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1i0i0w1r1i1r1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r1r1r1i0w1i1i1i0i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i1<masked_digit>r\n\nGiven the misunderstanding in the representation, the correct approach to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w' in \"w1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1i0i0w1r1i1r1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r1r1r1i0w1i1i1i0i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i1r\" should indeed directly modify the sequence. The final masked sequence, correctly represented within the context of the task, should be:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1i0i0w1r1i1r1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r1r1r1i0w1i1i1i0i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i1<masked_digit>r<sequence_end>"}
