However, following the task's instruction to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and considering the 'w' is the last character, the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there is no digit to mask. \n\nHowever, to adhere to the task's request as closely as possible and provide a meaningful response, I will interpret the task as requiring the identification of the rightmost 'w' and then handle the absence of a following digit by indicating this in the output.\n\nGiven the input string ends with 'w1w1i1i1r', the actual rightmost 'w' is followed by a '1'.

The correct sequence to consider for masking is thus directly after the last 'w', which is indeed '1'. The correct output, adhering strictly to the format and instructions provided, should therefore directly integrate '<masked_digit>' into the sequence without additional characters. \n\nGiven the input and the task to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', the accurate output should directly replace the digit '1' with '<masked_digit>' in the sequence, resulting in the correct masked sequence as per the instructions. \n\nThe final answer is: \n<sequence_start>w1i0i0i1i1w1i0i1r1w1w1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i0r1i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i0w0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r1w0i0i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i1w1i1i0i1i0i0i1r1w1i1i0i0r<w><masked_digit></sequence_end><sequence_end>"}
