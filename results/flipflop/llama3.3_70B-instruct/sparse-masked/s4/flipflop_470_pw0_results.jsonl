After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1r. However, there is no 'w' at the very end, so I look for the last occurrence of 'w' before the end. The last 'w' is in the sequence: ...w1i0i1r1i0w0... No, this 'w' is not the rightmost. The rightmost 'w' is actually in the sequence: ...i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r0i0i1i0r0i1w1... No, this 'w' is not the rightmost either. The actual rightmost 'w' is in the sequence: ...i0i1i1i0w0i0i0r0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i1i1w1... No, this 'w' is not the rightmost. The actual rightmost 'w' is: ...i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1 is not a 'w', the 'w' before that is: ...i1i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1r and before that is ...w1w1i0i1r1i0w0... The 'w' before that is ...i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r1i1i1w1w1... The rightmost 'w' is actually the second 'w' in the sequence: ...i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r1i1i1w1w1...\n\nNow, I identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character, which is '1'.\n\nNext, I replace the identified digit '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n<sequence_start>w1i0r1i0i1i1w0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1w0r0r0i0w1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0w0i0i0i0w0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0w1i0i0i0i1i1i0r1i1i1w1<masked_digit>i0i1r1i0w0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i0i1i0r0i1w1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0w0i1i1i1w0i0i0r0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i1i1w1i1i0i0i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1r<sequence_end>"}
