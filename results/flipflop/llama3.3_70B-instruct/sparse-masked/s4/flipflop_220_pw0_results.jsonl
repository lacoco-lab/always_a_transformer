The correct approach should directly modify the original string by finding the last 'w', and then replacing the next character with '<masked_digit>' if it's a digit.\n\nCorrecting the approach:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is before '0i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1w0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r'. The digit after this 'w' is '0'.
