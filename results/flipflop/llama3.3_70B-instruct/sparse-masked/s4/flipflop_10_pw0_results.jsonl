Find the rightmost 'w': The string is scanned from right to left to find the last occurrence of 'w'. The rightmost 'w' is in the position: w0w**0**i0i0r, here 'w' is at the 3rd position from the left, but since we are looking from the right, let's correctly identify it by counting from the right: r (1st from right), 0 (2nd), i (3rd), 0 (4th), i (5th), 0 (6th), w (7th), 0 (8th), w (9th). So, 'w' at the 7th position from the left (or 3rd from the right in the sequence w0w0i0i0r) is the rightmost 'w'.\n\n2. Identify the digit after the rightmost 'w': The digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' (which is at the 7th position from the left) is '0'.\n\n3. Mask the digit: Replace the '0' after the rightmost 'w' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string is: w0w<masked_digit>i0i0r\n\nNow, I will put the masked sequence between '<sequence_start>' and '<sequence_end>"}
