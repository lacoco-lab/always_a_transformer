However, looking at the string, the last 'w' is actually followed by no digit, it's at the very end. The last 'w' before the end is: ...i1w0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0w0i1i1i0r0i0w1...\n\nSo the rightmost 'w' that has a digit after it is: ...i1w0...\n\nThe digit after this 'w' is '0'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\nReplace '0' with <masked_digit>: ...i1w<masked_digit>...\n\nNow, let's print the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
