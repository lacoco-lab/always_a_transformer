After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the position before the last '0i1r0i0w0' sequence, which is 'w0i1r0i0w0'. The rightmost 'w' is the second 'w' in this sequence.\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. I will replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string:\nw1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1r1i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i0r1r1r1i1i0r1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i1i0r1r1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i0i1i0w0i1i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1i0r0i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0w1i1i0w1i0i1r1i1i1i0w0i0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0w0i1r0i0w<masked_digit>i1r0i0w0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r\n\nNow, I will put the modified string between '<sequence_start>' and '<sequence_end>"}

We start from the end of the string and move towards the beginning until we find a 'w'.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is found at the position where the string ends with \"...i0w0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1w1i0r\". The 'w' in question is the last 'w' in the string.\n\nNow, we identify the digit immediately after this 'w'. The digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nNext, we replace this '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i0i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0w1r1i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i1w0i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w1i0i1r1i1w1r1w1i1i0r1i1i1r1i0w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1w1i0r</sequence_end> is incorrect because the masking was not applied.\n\nLet's correct that by actually applying the mask to the digit after the last 'w':\n\nThe correct string with the last 'w' followed by '0' should be modified to end with \"...i0w<masked_digit>...\".\n\n\nHere is the corrected sequence with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i0i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0w1r1i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i1w0i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w1i0i1r1i1w1r1w1i1i0r1i1i1r1i0w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1w1i0r</sequence_end> is still incorrect.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the string and apply the mask correctly.\n\n\nThe input string is: w0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i0i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0w1r1i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i1w0i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w1i0i1r1i1w1r1w1i1i0r1i1i1r1i0w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1w1i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the end of the substring \"...i0w0...\". The digit after this 'w' is '0'.\n\n\nNow, let's replace this '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\n\nThe resulting string is: w0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i0i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0w1r1i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i1w0i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w1i0i1r1i1w1r1w1i1i0r1i1i1r1i0w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1w1i0r\n\n\nThe correct masking should result in: \nw0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i0i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0w1r1i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i1w0i0i0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w1i0i1r1i1w1r1w1i1i0r1i<sequence_end>"}
