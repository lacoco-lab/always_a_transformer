However, looking at the string, the last 'w' is actually part of 'w0' or 'w1' patterns throughout. The very last 'w' is in 'i0i1i0r', which does not directly follow a 'w' but indicates we are at the end. The actual last 'w' before the end that has a digit after it is in the sequence 'w1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0r1i0i1w0...'. Thus, the rightmost 'w' with a digit after it is 'w1' in '...w1i1...'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\nThe digit after the rightmost 'w' with a following digit is '1'.
