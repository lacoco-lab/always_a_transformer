After examining the string, we find that the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string: ...i1r1w1i0i1i1i0i1i1w1r1i1r. There are actually two 'w's at the end, and the very last 'w' is the rightmost one.\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nNow, we replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\nw0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i0w1r1i0w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i1i0r1i1i1w0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1r1w1i0i0i0i1r1w1i0i1i1i0i1i1w1r1i1w<masked_digit>i0i1i1i0i1i1\n\nHowever, upon re-examining the instructions for the task, it seems there was an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the exact position of the rightmost 'w' and the subsequent masking operation. Given the correct identification of the rightmost 'w' and the digit following it, the correct masking should directly replace the digit after the last 'w' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nCorrecting the approach based on the accurate identification of the rightmost 'w' and the subsequent digit to be masked:\n\nThe correct sequence after masking the digit following the rightmost 'w' should indeed directly replace the '1' after the last 'w' with '<masked_digit>', resulting in the corrected sequence:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i0w1r1i0w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i1i0r1i1i1w0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1r1w1i0i0i0i1r1w1i0i1i1i0i1i1w1r1i1w<masked_digit>i0i1i1i0i1i1<sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, and it is followed by the character 'r', not a digit. However, since the task specifically asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', I need to find the second rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, I find the second rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit: ...i0w0r. Here, the 'w' is followed by the digit '0'.\n\nNow, I will replace the digit '0' with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (that is followed by a digit) masked is:\nw0i0i0i0i0i0i0w0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i1w1i1w1i1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0r0r0r0w1i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1w0i1i0i0w0r0i0w1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r1w<masked_digit>r\n\nHere is the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
