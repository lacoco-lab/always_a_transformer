Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3.

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"...i0r\".\n\nNow, I will identify the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Since the 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it. However, the task requires masking a digit after a 'w'. Given the string structure, I will consider the last 'w' that has a digit after it.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, I find the last 'w' that has a digit after it is \"...w0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1w0w0...\". The 'w' in question is the one before \"...0i0...\". The digit after this 'w' is '0'.\n\nNow, I will replace this '0' with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (that has a digit after it) masked is:\nw0r0i0i0i0i0i0w0r0i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i1w0i1i0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0r0w1i1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1w0i0i1i0w0i1i1w0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1w0w0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1w0i0i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i1i0i0r\n\nThe digit to be masked is the '0' after the last 'w' that has a digit after it. The correct position of the 'w' with a digit after it is \"...w<masked_digit>i0...\".\n\nHere is the masked sequence:\n<sequence_start>w0r0i0i0i0i0i0w0r0i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i1w0i1i0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0r0w1i1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1w0i0i1i0w0i1i1w0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1w0w0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1w0i0i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i1i0i0r</sequence_end>\n\nHowever, the correct output should have the digit after the 'w' masked. The correct output is:\n<sequence_start>w0r0i0i0i0i0i0w0r0i1i0i0i1i1w1i1i0i0i0i1w1i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i1w0i1i0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0r0w1i1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1w0i0i1i0w0i1i1w0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1w0w0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1w0i0i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i1i0i0r</sequence_start>\n\nNow, I will mask the correct digit:\nThe last 'w' with a digit after it is at the position \"...w0i0...\".

Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\nInput string: w1i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0i1i0r1i1i1w1i1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1w1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0w0r0i0i1w1i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i1w1i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1r\n\nStep 1: Find the rightmost 'w' character.\nThe rightmost 'w' character is at the end of the string: ...i1i0i1r\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\nSince the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it. However, looking at the string, the last 'w' is actually \"w1\" and then the string ends with \"i1i0i1r\". So the rightmost 'w' is \"w1\" and the digit after it is \"1\".\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\nReplace \"1\" with <masked_digit> to get: w<masked_digit>i1i0i1r\n\nNow, the modified string with the masked digit is:\nw1i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0i1i0r1i1i1w1i1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1w1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0w0r0i0i1w1i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i1w1i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1r becomes \nw1i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0i1i0r1i1i1w1i1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1w1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0w0r0i0i1w1i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i1w1i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1w<masked_digit>i1i0i1r\n\nThe final answer is: \n<sequence_start>w1i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i0i1i0r1i1i1w1i1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0i0i1r1w1i1i1r1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0w0r0i0i1w1i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i1w1i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1w<masked_digit>i1i0i1r<sequence_end>"}
