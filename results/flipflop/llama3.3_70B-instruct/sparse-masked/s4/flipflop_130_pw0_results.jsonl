Let's recheck the rightmost 'w' and the digit after it.\n\nThe correct rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"r0w0i1r0i1i1i1i0i1r0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i0r\".

The correct replacement should be in the original string where '0' comes after the last 'w'. \n\nThe correct string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' replaced with <masked_digit> is:\nw0i0i1i0r0i1r0r0w0w0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0w0i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0i1r0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i0r becomes \nw0i0i1i0r0i1r0r0w0w0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0w0i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i0i1r0i1i1i1i0i1r0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i0<masked_digit> is incorrect.\n\nLet's try again from the end of the string to find the last 'w' and the digit after it.\nThe string ends with \"0i1r0i1i1i1i1i0r\".

Here, 'w' is followed by '0'. \n\nSo, the correct replacement is in \"r0w0\".
