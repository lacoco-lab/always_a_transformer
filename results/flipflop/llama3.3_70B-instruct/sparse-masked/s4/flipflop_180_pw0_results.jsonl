After examining the string, we find that the last 'w' is at the very end of the string: ...w1w1r, the second to last 'w' is also part of 'w1w1', so the rightmost 'w' that is not part of 'w1w1' at the end is actually part of 'w1' before the last 'w1w1r'.

Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3.

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w0i0i0r0i1r\".\n\nNext, I identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character, which is '0'.\n\nNow, I replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string is: w<masked_digit>r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i1r\n\nHowever, to accurately represent the original task, I need to ensure that I'm modifying the correct 'w' and the digit that immediately follows it in the entire string, not just a part of it. Given the entire string and the task, the correct approach involves finding the last occurrence of 'w' and then masking the digit that follows it.\n\nGiven the string: w0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0w1r1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1r1r1i1w1i1r1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0w0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0w0i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is indeed at the end of the string, and the digit after it is '0'. So, the correct masking should result in the string ending with \"w<masked_digit>r\" instead of the original \"w0r\".\n\nHere is the corrected approach to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n\n1. Find the last index of 'w' in the string.\n2. Check if there are characters after this 'w'.\n3. If there are, and the next character is a digit, replace it with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nGiven the input string and applying the above steps correctly:\n\nThe last 'w' is followed by '0', which is a digit. So, the correct output after masking should be the original string with '0' replaced by '<masked_digit>' after the last 'w'.\n\nThus, the final masked sequence, considering the entire string and the task, should correctly reflect the replacement of the digit immediately following the rightmost 'w' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\n<sequence_start>w0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0w1r1i1r1r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1r1r1i1w1i1r1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0w0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0w0i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i1w<masked_digit>r</sequence_end><sequence_end>"}

Let's correct that and follow the exact format requested for the output, focusing on the precise replacement without additional characters:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is followed by '0'. So, the correct masking should directly replace this '0' with <masked_digit>, resulting in the correct output without extra additions or changes to the string's original content beyond the specified masking.\n\nGiven the input and the task to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', the correct approach directly modifies the original string by replacing the digit after the last 'w' with <masked_digit>, ensuring the rest of the string remains unchanged.\n\nThus, the correct output, following the precise instructions and maintaining the original string's integrity except for the specified replacement, should be directly provided as per the task's requirements, focusing on the accurate masking of the digit following the last occurrence of 'w' in the input string. \n\nHere is the corrected output in the requested format:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0w1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i0i0i0i0w0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0w0r0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1w0i0i1i0i1r0<masked_digit>r</sequence_end><sequence_end>"}
