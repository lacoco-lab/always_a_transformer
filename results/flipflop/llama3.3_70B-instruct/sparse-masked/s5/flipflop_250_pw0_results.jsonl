After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"i1i1r\".\n\nNow, I will identify the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Since the rightmost 'w' is followed by '0', I will replace '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i1r1w0w0i1r0i1i1i0r0i0r0i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i0r0r0w1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0w1i0r1w0i0r0w0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0w0r0i1w1i0i1w1i1r1w0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i1r0i0i0i1i1w1i0i1i1i0i0i0r1i0r1i0i0i0i1w1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r1w0w0i0r0i1i1<masked_digit></sequence_end>\n\nHowever, upon re-examining my previous response, I realized I made an error in identifying the rightmost 'w'. Let me re-evaluate the string.\n\nThe correct rightmost 'w' is indeed at the position before the last '0'.
