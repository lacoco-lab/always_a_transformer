After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w0w0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0r\".\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. \n\nNow, I replace this '0' with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the modified string with the <masked_digit> tag:\n<sequence_start>w0i0r0i0w1i0i0r1i0w0i1i0i0r0w1i1i0i0i0i0i0r1r1i0i1i1i1i1w1i0i1i0i1r1w0i1i0i1i1i0i1r0w1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i1i1r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1w0i1i0i1r0i1w0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i0i0w1i1i1i0r1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0w0r0i0i1i1w0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0w0w0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0r0<masked_digit>w0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0r</sequence_end>\n\nHowever, upon re-examining my steps, I realized the correct approach should directly identify and mask the digit following the last 'w' without adding extra characters or altering the original string's structure beyond the specified masking. The correct masking should occur at the position right after the last 'w' in the sequence, which is part of the original string, not adding an extra 'w' as my initial explanation might have suggested.\n\nGiven the correct approach, the task requires identifying the last 'w', then masking the digit immediately following it. The correct sequence to consider for masking is the original string itself, without any additions. \n\nLet's re-evaluate the string to correctly identify the last 'w' and the digit that follows it for masking.\n\nUpon a detailed review, the correct masking should be applied directly to the original string without any additions or modifications beyond the specified task. The focus is on the last occurrence of 'w' and the digit that immediately follows it.\n\nTo accurately complete the task as described, the correct step involves directly modifying the original string by masking the digit that follows the last 'w' with the <masked_digit> tag, without altering the string's original content or structure beyond this specific modification.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precision in identifying the correct position for masking, the task requires a careful examination of the string to ensure the modification is applied correctly.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<sequence_start>w0i0r0i0w1i0i0r1i0w0i1i0i0r0w1i1i0i0i0i0i0r1r1i0i1i1i1i1w1i0i1i0i1r1w0i1i0i1i1i0i1r0w1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i1i1r0i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1w0i1i0i1r0i1w0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i0i0w1i1i1i0r1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0w0r0i0i1i1w0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0r0r0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0w0w0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0r0<masked_digit>w0</sequence_end><sequence_end>"}
