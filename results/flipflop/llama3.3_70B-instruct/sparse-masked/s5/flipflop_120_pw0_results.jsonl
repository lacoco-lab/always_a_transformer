However, since the task specifically asks to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and there are multiple 'w's, we need to consider the second to last 'w' for the purpose of this task.\n\nUpon re-examining the string for the purpose of this task, we find the sequence \"...w0w0...\" which indicates the last 'w' before the end of the string is part of \"...w0w0...\". Thus, the digit after the 'w' that we are interested in is '0', which is part of \"...w0...\" in \"...w0w0...\".\n\nStep 2 & 3: Since the digit after the 'w' we are considering is '0', we replace this '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (considering the task's requirement) masked is:\nw1i0r1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i1i1r1i1i1i0w0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1w0w<masked_digit>w0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1i1r0i0i1r\n\nNow, let's print the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
