Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw1i1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i0w1i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i1w1i0i0i1r1i1i0i1r1w1i1i0i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i0i0w0w0i1i1r0i1w0i0i0i0r0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0r0i1r0i0i1i1i0r0r\n\nFirst, I find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w0w0...\". The last 'w' is the one I am interested in.\n\nThe digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nNow, I replace this '0' with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n<sequence_start>w1i1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i0w1i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i1w1i0i0i1r1i1i0i1r1w1i1i0i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i0i0w0w0i1i1r0i1w0i0i0i0r0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0r0i1r0i0i1i1i0r0w0<masked_digit>...</sequence_end>\n\nHowever, I realized the correct approach should involve actually modifying the string by replacing the digit after the last 'w' with <masked_digit>. Let's correct that and provide the accurate modified string.\n\n\nThe correct approach to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w' involves finding the last occurrence of 'w', then replacing the next character (if it's a digit) with <masked_digit>. Given the input string ends with \"w0w0i1i1r0i1w0i0i0i0r0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0r0i1r0i0i1i1i0r0r\", the rightmost 'w' is actually before the last '0' in \"w0\". Thus, the digit to be masked is '0'.\n\n\nHere is the corrected approach to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n1. Find the last 'w', which is in \"w0\".\n2. The digit after this 'w' is '0'.\n3. Replace '0' with <masked_digit>.\n\n\nThe modified string with the correct masking is:\nw1i1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i0w1i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i1w1i0i0i1r1i1i0i1r1w1i1i0i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0i1r0i0i0i0w0w<masked_digit>i1i1r0i1w0i0i0i0r0i1i0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0r0i1r0i0i1i1i0r0r\n\n\nSo, the final masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
