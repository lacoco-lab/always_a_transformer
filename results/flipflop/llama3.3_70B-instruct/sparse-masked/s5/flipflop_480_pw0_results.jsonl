The actual rightmost 'w' is indeed near the end but not at the very end. It is part of the sequence ...i0w0r0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0w1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r, specifically the 'w' in ...i0w0... and another 'w' in ...i1i1i1w1... and the last 'w' is in ...i0w0... and ...i0w1... and the very last 'w' is in ...i0w1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is actually in the sequence ...i0w1... and it is followed by the digit '1'. \n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. I will replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw0w0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1w1i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i1w1r1i1i0i1i1i1i0r1i0r1i1i0w1i1w1w1r1w0r0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i1r0r0i1r0i1w0r0i1w0i1i1r0i1i0w1r1r1i0i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i1w1r1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1w0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0r0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0w1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r becomes \nw0w0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1w1i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i1w1r1i1i0i1i1i1i0r1i0r1i1i0w1i1w1w1r1w0r0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i1r0r0i1r0i1w0r0i1w0i1i1r0i1i0w1r1r1i0i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i1w1r1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1w0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0r0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0w1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in the sequence: ...i0w1... \nSo the correct masked string is:\nw0w0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1w1i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i1w1r1i1i0i1i1i1<sequence_end>"}
