Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\nInput string: w1i1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1w1i1w1i1i1r1i1r1i1i0i0w1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1r1r1i0i0i1i0w0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i0w1w1i0r1i0w1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0w1w1i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0r0r\n\nStep 1: Find the rightmost 'w' character.\nAfter examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' character is at the position where \"w0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0w1w1\" is present, specifically the 'w' before \"0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0\".\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, there is another 'w' after this, which is part of \"w1w1i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1w0\". The very last 'w' is actually in \"w1w1\", and then there's \"w0\" later, but the last 'w' before any digits that we care about for masking is indeed in \"w1w1\".\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' that has a digit after it and is not immediately followed by another 'w' (in the context of our task) is actually the second 'w' in \"w1w1\".\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' (in \"w1w1\") is '1'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\nReplace '1' with <masked_digit>.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1w1i1w1i1i1r1i1r1i1i0i0w1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1r1r1i0i0i1i0w0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i1i1i1r0i1i1i0w1w1i0r1i0w1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0w1w1i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0r0rw1<masked_digit>1i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i1i1i0i0i1r1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0r0r<sequence_end>"}

However, looking at the string, the last 'w' is actually followed by no digit, it's at the very end. The second to last 'w' is followed by a '1', but we need to mask the digit after the last 'w' which does not exist as the string ends right after the 'w'. However, following the instructions to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and given the 'w' is at the end, the task as described does not apply directly because there is no digit to mask. \n\nHowever, to follow the instructions as closely as possible and to provide a meaningful response, I will assume the task implies masking the digit after the last 'w' that has a following digit, which would be the second to last 'w' in the sequence. The digit after this 'w' is '1'. \n\nThus, the corrected approach to mask the digit after the last 'w' that has a digit following it (since the very last 'w' does not have a digit after it) would be to replace the '1' after the second to last 'w' with <masked_digit>.\n\nThe corrected string with the digit after the second to last 'w' masked (since the last 'w' does not have a digit to mask) is:\nw1i0i0i0i0r1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0w1i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i1i1i0i0i0w0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1w0i0i1r0w1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w1i0i0r1w1i0w1i1i1w1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i1w0i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0w0i0r0w0r0r0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0r0w<masked_digit>1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w1i0i0r1w1i0w1i1i1w1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i1w0i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0w0i0r0w0r0r0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0r\n\nGiven the misunderstanding in the task due to the 'w' being at the end, the above correction assumes masking the digit after the last 'w' that has a digit following it. \n\n<sequence_start>w1i0i0i0i0r1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0w1i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i1i1i0i0i0w0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1w0i0i1r0w1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w1i0i0r1w1i0w1i1i1w1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i1w0i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0w0i0r0w0r0r0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0r0w<masked_digit>1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w1i0i0r1w1i0w1i1i1w1i1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r1i1i1w0i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0w0i0r0w0r0r0i1i1i1r0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0r<sequence_end>"}
