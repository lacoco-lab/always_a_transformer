Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\nInput string: w0r0i0w0i1i1i1i0r0i0i1i1i0r0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i0r0r0i0i1i1i1i1r\n\n1. Finding the rightmost 'w' character:\n   - The string is scanned from right to left to find the last occurrence of 'w'.\n   - The rightmost 'w' is found at the position where 'w' appears just before '0i1i1i1i1r'.\n\n2. Identifying the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - The digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n3. Masking the digit:\n   - Replace '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw0r0i0w0i1i1i1i0r0i0i1i1i0r0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i0r0r0i0<masked_digit>i1i1i1i1r\n\nNow, placing the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
