Find the last index of 'w':\n   - The string is scanned from right to left.\n   - The last 'w' is found.\n\n2. The digit after the last 'w' is '0' (as per the corrected understanding of the string).\n\n3. The digit '0' is replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nCorrecting my approach and actually performing the task:\n\nInput string: w1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0r1i1r1i1i0i1i1w0i0i0w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0w0i0i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0i1r0i0r0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0r\n\nLast 'w' is at the position before the last '0' in \"w0i0i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0i1r0i0r0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0r\", which is \"w0\".\n\nSo, the correct masking should result in:\nw1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0r1i1r1i1i0i1i1w0i0i0w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0w0i0i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0i1r0i0r0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0<masked_digit>r\n\nHowever, the accurate masking should directly replace the digit following the last 'w', which is indeed '0'. The correct output should directly mask this '0' without adding extra characters at the end. \n\nThe correct sequence after masking the digit following the rightmost 'w' is:\nw1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0r1i1r1i1i0i1i1w0i0i0w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0w0i0i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0i1r0i0r0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0<masked_digit>r is incorrect due to the addition of '<masked_digit>' at the end instead of replacing the actual digit after the last 'w'.\n\nCorrectly identifying the last 'w' and replacing the digit immediately after it:\nThe last 'w' is in \"w0\", so the '0' after it should be replaced.\n\nThus, the correct masking should be:\nw1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0r1i1r1i1i0i1i1w0i0i0w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0w0i0i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0i1r0i0r0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0w<masked_digit>i0i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0i1r0i0r0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0r\n\n<sequence_start>w1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0r1i1r1i1i0i1i1w0i0i0w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r0w0i0i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0i1r0i0r0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0w<masked_digit>i0i0i1i0i1i1w0i0i0i1r0i0r0i0r0i0i0r0i1r0r<sequence_end>"}

Finding the rightmost 'w' character:\n   - The input string is scanned from right to left to find the last occurrence of 'w'.\n   - The rightmost 'w' is found at the position before '0i0i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r'.\n\n2. Identifying the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - The character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n3. Masking the digit:\n   - Replace '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1w1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i0i1i0w1i0r1i1i1w<masked_digit>i0i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r\n\nNow, placing the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
