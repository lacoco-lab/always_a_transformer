However, since the task requires masking the digit after the rightmost 'w', and there is no digit after it, the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there's nothing to mask. But to follow the instructions as closely as possible and to provide a meaningful response, I will indicate that there is no digit to mask by placing the '<masked_digit>' tag at the end, acknowledging the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string.\n\nTherefore, the modified string, taking into account the requirement to mask a digit that does not exist after the last 'w', would be:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1r0i0i0w0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1r0r0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1w0i0r0w1w1i1r1i0i0i0i0i0w1i1i1i1i1r1i0i1i0w0i1i0w0i0i1r0r0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1r<masked_digit></sequence_end>\n\nHowever, this approach does not strictly follow the task since there's no digit to mask after the last 'w'. The correct interpretation of the task, given the constraints, would be to leave the string unchanged because there is no digit immediately following the rightmost 'w' to mask. \n\nThus, the accurate response, adhering strictly to the task's conditions and the format requested, should reflect that no modification is made because the condition (a digit after the rightmost 'w') is not met:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1r0i0i0w0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1r0r0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1w0i0r0w1w1i1r1i0i0i0i0i0w1i1i1i1i1r1i0i1i0w0i1i0w0i0i1r0r0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1r</sequence_end><sequence_end>"}

However, since the task asks to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and there is no digit after the last 'w' (as it is at the end of the string), the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there is no digit to mask.\n\nHowever, to follow the instructions to the letter as requested and given the nature of the task, the most accurate interpretation is that since there's no digit after the last 'w' to mask, the string remains unchanged in terms of masking a digit. But to fulfill the request for the format:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i0r1i1i1i0i1w0i1i0i1i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i1r1i1r1w1w1i0i0r1i1i0r1i1i1i1r1i0i1i1i0r1i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i0r0i0i1i1r0i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0w1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1w0i0i1w0w0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1r</sequence_end>\n\nNote: Since the task involves masking a digit that does not exist (as it's after the last character), the original string is presented as is, without any modifications.<sequence_end>"}
