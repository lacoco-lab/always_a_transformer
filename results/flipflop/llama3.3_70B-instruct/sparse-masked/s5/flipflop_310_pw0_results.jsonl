Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i0i1i1w1r1i0i0i0w1i0i0r1i0i0r1i0i0i0w1w1w1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i0i0i1i0w1i1w1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0i1i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i0r0i0i0r\n\nNow, let's find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w0i1i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i0r0i0i0r\" is not the rightmost 'w', the rightmost 'w' is actually \"w0\" in \"w0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0\" is also not the rightmost 'w', the rightmost 'w' is actually in \"w1w1w1\".\n\nHowever, the rightmost 'w' is actually the last 'w' in \"w1w1w1\". \n\nSo the rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in \"w1w1w1\". The digit immediately after it is '0' in \"w0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0\" is not the right digit, the right digit is '0' in \"w0\" which comes after the last 'w' in \"w1w1w1\" which is not present, the correct 'w' is the last 'w' in the string \"w1w1w1\" and the digit after it is '0' which is not present, the correct digit is 'i' which is not a digit, the correct 'w' is the last 'w' and the correct digit after it is not 'i' but '0' is not present after the last 'w', the correct digit after the last 'w' is 'i' which is not a digit.\n\nHowever, the last 'w' is in \"w1w1w1\" and the digit after the last 'w' in \"w1w1w1\" is 'i' which is not a digit, but 'i' is followed by '1' which is a digit.\n\nThe last 'w' is in \"w1w1w1\" and the digit immediately after the last 'w' is 'i' which is not a digit, the digit immediately after 'i' is '1'.\n\nSo the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. \n\nNow, let's replace '1' with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the modified string:\n<sequence_start>w1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i0i1i1w1r1i0i0i0w1i0i0r1i0i0r1i0i0i0w1w1w1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i0i0i1i0w1i1w1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0i1i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i0r0i0i0r</sequence_start>\n\nNow, let's find the last 'w' and replace the digit after it.\nThe last 'w' is in \"w1w1w1\" and the digit after the last 'w' is 'i' which is not a digit, the digit after 'i' is '1'. \n\nSo the modified string is:\n<sequence_start>w1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i0i1i1w1r1i0i0i0w1i0i0r1i0i0r1i0i0i0w1w1w<masked_digit>1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i0i0i1i0w1i1w1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0i1i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i0r0i0i0r</sequence_start>\n\nHowever, the above string is not correct, the correct string should have the '1' after the last 'w' replaced with <masked_digit>.\n\nHere is the correct modified string:\n<sequence_start>w1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i0i1i1w1r1i0i0i0w1i0i0r1i0i0r1i0i0i0w1w1w1i<masked_digit>0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i0i0i1i0w1i1w1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0i1i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i0r0i0i0r</sequence_start>\n\nNow, the task is complete. The digit after the rightmost 'w' has been replaced with the <masked_digit> tag<sequence_end>"}

The last 'w' followed by a digit is in \"w1i1i1i0r1i0i1r\".\n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is '1'.\n\nNow, I replace this '1' with <masked_digit>.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw1i1r1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i1r1i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i0w1r1r1i0i0i0i0r1i1i0i0r1i0i0i0i1i1w0i1i1w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r0i0i0w1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1r1i0w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1w1i1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0w0w0i1i0i1i0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w1<masked_digit>i1i1i0r1i0i1r\n\nHere is the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw1i1i0i1i0i1r1r1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1w0r0r0i0i1i1w1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1w0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i1w1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i1w1i0i1i0r1w0i1r0i1i0i1i0w0w0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r\n\nFirst, I find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the position before the last sequence of characters.\n\nNow, I will find the exact position of the rightmost 'w'. The last 'w' is at the end of the string \"w0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r\". The 'w' in question is the one right before \"0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r\".\n\nThe digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. I will replace this '0' with <masked_digit>.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n<sequence_start>w1i1i0i1i0i1r1r1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1w0r0r0i0i1i1w1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1w0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i1w1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i1w1i0i1i0r1w0i1r0i1i0i1i0w0w0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0r becomes w1i1i0i1i0i1r1r1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1w0r0r0i0i1i1w1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1w0i0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i1w1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i1w1i0i1i0r1w0i1r0i1i0i1i0w0w0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1w0i<masked_digit>i0i0i0i0i1i0r<sequence_end>"}
