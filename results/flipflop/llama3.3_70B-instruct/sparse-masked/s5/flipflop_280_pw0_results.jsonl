Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after this 'w' character.\n3. Replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the algorithmic solution:\n\nInput string: w0i1w0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i0i1w0r0i0i0i1i1i0w1r1i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r\n\nFirst, let's find the rightmost 'w' character. We can do this by iterating through the string from right to left and stopping at the first 'w' we encounter.\n\nAfter examining the string, the rightmost 'w' is found at the position before the last sequence of characters.\n\nNow, let's find the position of the rightmost 'w'. Since the string is quite long, we'll do this programmatically or by inspection. By inspection or using a programming approach, we find that the last 'w' is followed by '1' in the sequence 'w1' which appears multiple times, but we are interested in the very last occurrence of 'w' followed by a digit.\n\nThe last 'w' followed by a digit is 'w1' and it appears that the last 'w' is indeed part of 'w1'. \n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. We will replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1w0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i0i1w0r0i0i0i1i1i0w1r1i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r</sequence_end> is not correct because we didn't mask the digit.\n\nLet's correct that by actually replacing the last '1' after 'w' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nGiven the complexity of manually editing the string, the approach involves finding the last occurrence of 'w' followed by a digit and then replacing that digit. \n\nThe correct approach to mask the digit after the last 'w' in \"w1\" would result in \"w<masked_digit>\" in its last occurrence.\n\nThe last 'w' is in 'w1', so we replace the '1' with '<masked_digit>' to get 'w<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the corrected sequence with the last '1' after 'w' replaced:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1w0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i0i1w0r0i0i0i1i1i0w1r1i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1rw<masked_digit></sequence_end>\n\nNote: The above solution assumes that the last 'w' is indeed followed by a '1' and that 'w1' is the correct sequence to modify.
