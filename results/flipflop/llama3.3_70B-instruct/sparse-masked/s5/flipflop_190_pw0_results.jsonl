After examining the string, we find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"i1w1i1i1r\".\n\nNow, we identify the digit after this 'w', which is '1'.\n\nNext, we replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string is: w0i1r0i1i1i0w1i1i1i0r1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1w0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0w0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0w1w1r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i0i1w1i1i1<masked_digit>\n\nHowever, the correct replacement should be made in the original string by replacing the '1' after the last 'w' with '<masked_digit>'. The correct sequence after replacement is: \nw0i1r0i1i1i0w1i1i1i0r1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1w0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0w0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0w1w1r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i0i1w1i1i1<masked_digit>\n\nBut to accurately represent the replacement in the context of the original task, we should consider the entire string up to the point of replacement. The correct approach to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w' involves directly modifying the original string at the specified position.\n\nGiven the original string and the task to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', the accurate step involves finding the last occurrence of 'w' and then replacing the immediately following digit. \n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in \"i1w1i1i1r\", and the digit after it is '1'. So, the correct masking should result in \"i1w<masked_digit>i1i1r\" at the end of the string.\n\nThus, the correct masked sequence, considering the entire original string and the specified modification, is:\n<sequence_start>w0i1r0i1i1i0w1i1i1i0r1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1w0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0w0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0w1w1r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i0i1w1i1i1<masked_digit></sequence_end>\n\nHowever, the precise instruction is to mask the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w', which means the correct output should reflect the replacement of the digit '1' with '<masked_digit>' in the sequence \"i1w1i1i1r\" to \"i1w<masked_digit>i1i1r\". The entire string up to that point remains unchanged.\n\nCorrecting the approach for the final representation:\nThe original string ends with \"i1w1i1i1r\", and we need to replace the '1' after the 'w' with '<masked_digit>', resulting in the ending \"i1w<masked_digit>i1i1r\".\n\nSo, the final masked sequence should be:\n<sequence_start>w0i1r0i1i1i0w1i1i1i0r1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1w0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0w0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i0w1w1r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i0i1w1i1i1i1w<masked_digit>i1i1r</sequence_end><sequence_end>"}
