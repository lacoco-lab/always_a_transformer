After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string, but since there are multiple 'w's at the end, I will consider the one that is not part of a sequence of 'w's at the very end but still the rightmost if considering all 'w's. However, given the instruction to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and considering the string ends with '...i0i0i0r', the actual rightmost 'w' before this sequence is the one to consider for masking the following digit.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the sequence \"...i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r\" contains a 'w' followed by a '0'. This 'w' is indeed the rightmost 'w' that is not at the very end of the string and is followed by a digit.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is not part of a sequence of 'w's at the very end is '0'. I will replace this '0' with <masked_digit>.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i1r0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i0i1i0i1w0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i0w0i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r0i0w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i1i0r1i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1w0w0i0i0i1i0i1r0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r0w0i0w0r0i0i0i0i0i0r0i0i1i0r0i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r0i1r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r<sequence_end>"}
