Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the input string: w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1w1i1r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i0w1r1i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i0r1r1i0r1w1i0r\n\nFirst, let's find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...w1i0r.\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. I will replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string: w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1w1i1r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i0w1r1i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i0r1r1i0r1w<masked_digit>i0r\n\nNow, I will put the modified string between the '<sequence_start>' and '<sequence_end>"}
