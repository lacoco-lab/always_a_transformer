Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\nInput string: w1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0r1i1w0i0i0i1r0i0i0r0i0r0w0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0w0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0w0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0w0r0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1w1i1i0i0r\n\nStep 1: Find the rightmost 'w' character.\nThe rightmost 'w' character is at the end of the string: ...i1i0i0r\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\nThere is no digit after the last 'w' because it is at the end of the string, but since there's no digit after it to mask, we look at the string and find the last 'w' that has a digit after it: ...w1...\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' with a digit after it is: ...w1...\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\nThe digit after the rightmost 'w' with a following digit is '1'. We replace it with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (that has a digit after it) masked:\nw1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0r1i1w0i0i0i1r0i0i0r0i0r0w0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0w0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0w0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0w0r0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1w<masked_digit>i1i0i0r\n\nHowever, the correct approach should be to find the last 'w' that has a digit immediately after it and mask that digit. Given the string structure, the last 'w' followed by a digit is indeed 'w1' but it appears at the beginning. The task, however, asks for the rightmost 'w' followed by a digit. Upon reevaluation, the correct 'w' to consider is the one before the last sequence of characters that includes a 'w' followed by a digit, which is 'w1' at the end of the string \"...i1w1i1i0i0r\". Thus, the correct masking should be applied to the '1' after the 'w' in \"...i1w1i1i0i0r\", resulting in \"...i1w<masked_digit>i1i0i0r\".\n\nCorrected string with the rightmost 'w' followed by a digit masked:\nw1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0r1i1w0i0i0i1r0i0i0r0i0r0w0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0w0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0w0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0w0r0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1w1i1i0i0r becomes \nw1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0r1i1w0i0i0i1r0i0i0r0i0r0w0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0w0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0w0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0w0r0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1w<masked_digit>i1i0i0r\n\n<sequence_start>w1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0r1i1w0i0i0i1r0i0i0r0i0r0w0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0w0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0w0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0w0r0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1w1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0w1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i1i1r1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1w<masked_digit>i1i0i0r<sequence_end>"}
