After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0i1r1i0i1r.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that I need to find the last occurrence of 'w' in the string. The last 'w' is actually: ...i1i0i1w0r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i1r\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. I will replace this '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n<sequence_start>w1r1i1i0i1w0i0i0i0i0i0i0r0w0r0i1i0i0i0i1r0r0i1i1i1i1i1w0i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0i0i1w1i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i1i0i0w1i0i1r1i1i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1r0i0i1r0r0i0i1r0i0w0w0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r0w1r1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0w1i0i1w1i0i1i1i0r1r1i0w0i0r0i0i0i1i0w1i1i0r1i0i1i0i0r1i0i0i0i1r1i0i1w1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i1i0i1r1r1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0w1r1i1i1i1i1i1r1w1r1i1w0i1i1w0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w0r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i1r1i0i1w1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i1i0i1r1r1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0w1r1i1i1i1i1i1r1w1r1i1w0i1i1w0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w0r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i0i1r<masked_digit>r0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0<sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0i1i1w0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0w0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r0r0i0w0i0i0i0i1i0r0i0r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1w0r0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string. The digit immediately after this 'w' is '0'. \n\nNow, I replace this '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n<sequence_start>w0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r0w1i0i1i0i0i1i1r1w0w0i1r0i1i0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0w0i1i1i0w0r0i1i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i0w0i0i1w0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i0r0i0r0i0r0i0w1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1r1w0r0i1i0i1i0i0w1i1i1i1i0w1i0i0i1i0r1i0i1i0r1i1w1i0i1i1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1w0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0w0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r0r0i0w0i0i0i0i1i0r0i0r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1w0<masked_digit>r</sequence_end>\n\nNote: The actual masking is done at the very end of the string where the last 'w' is found, and the digit '0' after it is replaced with '<masked_digit>'.<sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0i0r.\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1', but since there are no more characters after the last 'w', we should look at the last 'w' that has a digit after it. The last 'w' with a digit after it is 'w1' which appears multiple times. The rightmost 'w1' is the one we are looking for.\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' with a digit after it is 'w1'.

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string, but since there are multiple 'w's at the end, I will consider the last 'w' that is not followed by another 'w'. However, given the instruction, I will look for the very last 'w' in the sequence which is part of \"w1\" and it is indeed the last character before the digits start again, but since it's followed by digits, I will consider it for masking the digit after it.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in the sequence \"w1\" near the end.
