Thus, the digit after 'w' in 'w0' is indeed '0', and it should be masked.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\nThe input string with the digit '0' after the rightmost 'w' replaced with <masked_digit> is:\nw1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i0i0i1w1i1w1i0r1w1w1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i1r1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1r1i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1r1r1i1i1i0w<masked_digit>i1i0r0i1i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r\n\nNow, I will put the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
