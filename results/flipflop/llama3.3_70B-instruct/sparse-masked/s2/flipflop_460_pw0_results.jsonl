But, to adhere to the format requested for the output:\n\n<sequence_start>w1w1i0i1i1r1i0r1i1w0i1i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1w1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r1i0r1i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r1r1i1i1i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1r1i0i1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0w1i1i0i1r1i1w1r1i1i0i1w1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0w1i0i0i1r1w0w0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i1w0r0r0w1i0i0i1i1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i1w0w0i0w0i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0r</sequence_end>\n\nGiven the constraints and the specific request of the task, the above represents the input string as it is, without any modifications, because the condition to mask a digit after the rightmost 'w' cannot be fulfilled as the string ends with 'w' and does not have a digit immediately after it to mask.<sequence_end>"}

Upon finding it, we identify the next character as '0', which is a digit.\n\nSo, the digit '0' immediately after the rightmost 'w' will be replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0i0i0r0i0r0i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i1i1i0r0i0w1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0w1i1i0i1w1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i1i1r1i0i1i0i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i0r1i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i1r1i1r1r1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r0r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i1r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i0r1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0w1i0w1i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i1i0r1i0r1i0w0i1i1r0w1i1i1i1i0r</sequence_start> is incorrect as the masking was not performed.\n\nLet's correct that and perform the masking:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0w1i1i1i1i0r\n\nSo, the correct masking should replace the '1' after the last 'w' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nCorrected string:\nw0i0i0i0i0r0i0r0i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i1i1i0r0i0w1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0w1i1i0i1w1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i1i1r1i0i1i0i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i0r1i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i1r1i1r1r1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r0r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0w0i1i1r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i0r1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0w1i0w1i1w1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i1i0r1i0r1i0w0i1i1r0w1i1i1i1i0r becomes \nw0i0i0i0i0r0i0r0i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i1i1i0r0i0w1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1r1i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0w1i1i0i1w1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i1i1r1i0i1i0i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i0r1i0r1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0r1i0i0i1r1i1r1r1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r0r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i<sequence_end>"}

I will replace the '1' after this 'w' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the final masked sequence:\n<sequence_start>w1i0i1r1i1i0i0w1i1i0i0i0w1i1r1i1i0i1i0i1w0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i1i0i0i1i1w1i0w1w1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0w1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0w1r1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i0i0i1r1i0i1w1i1i1i1i<sequence_end>"}
