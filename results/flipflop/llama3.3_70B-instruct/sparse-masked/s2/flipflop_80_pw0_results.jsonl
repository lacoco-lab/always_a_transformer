Masking the digit:\n   - The identified digit '1' is replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw1i0i0r1i0i1i0i1w<masked_digit>i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1r\n\nNow, placing the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
