Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\nInput string: w0i1i0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0w1i0w1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1w1i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r\n\nStep 1: Find the rightmost 'w' character.\nThe rightmost 'w' character is at the position where 'w' appears last in the string.\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\nAfter finding the rightmost 'w', we look at the next character, which should be a digit.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\n\nNow, let's perform these steps on the given input string:\n\nThe input string is: w0i1i0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0w1i0w1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1w1i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the end of the substring \"...i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r\" which is not correct, the correct 'w' is in \"...i1w1i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1i0...\". \nSo the rightmost 'w' is in the substring \"...i1w1...\".\n\nThe digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. We will replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string is: w0i1i0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0w1i0w1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1w<masked_digit>i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r\n\nNow, let's put the masked sequence between '<sequence_start>' and '<sequence_end>"}
