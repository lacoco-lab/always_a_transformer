After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i0i0i0r\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is the last character in the string, and there is no digit after it.

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string, but since there are multiple 'w's at the end, I will consider the last 'w' that is not followed by another 'w'. However, given the instruction, I should look for the very last 'w' in the sequence and mask the digit after it. The last 'w' is indeed at the very end of the sequence, and it is followed by no digit because it is the last character. However, upon re-examining the task, it seems the intention might be to find the last 'w' that is followed by a digit. In this case, the last 'w' followed by a digit is 'w1' near the end of the string.\n\nThe last 'w' followed by a digit is 'w1'. The digit after this 'w' is '1'. I will replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (that is followed by a digit) masked:\n<sequence_start>w1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0r1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i0w1r1r1i1w0i0i0i1r0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r0i1i0w1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i0w1i1w1i1r1w1i0i0i1i0w1i1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i0r1i0i1i0i0r1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1w0w0w0i0i1i0w0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1w1i0r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i0w1w1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r1r1r</sequence_end>\n\nHowever, the correct approach based on the task description should involve finding the last 'w' and then masking the digit immediately after it. Given the string ends with 'w0w0w0i0i1i0w0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1w1i0r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i0w1w1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r1r1r', the actual last 'w' followed by a digit to mask would indeed be part of 'w1' but since the instruction asks for the digit after the last 'w', and considering the sequence properly, the last 'w' is indeed 'w1' but in the context 'w1' at the end of the string 'w1i1w1i1r1w1i0i0i1i0w1i1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i0r1i0i1i0i0r1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1w0w0w0i0i1i0w0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1w1i0r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i0w1w1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r1r1r', the correct 'w' to consider for masking the following digit is actually the second to last 'w' in 'w1' because it's the last 'w' that has a digit after it which is '1'. \n\nSo, the correct masking should be applied to the digit '1' in 'w1' which appears before the last sequence of 'w's without a following digit. \n\nThe correct sequence with the digit after the last 'w' (that is followed by a digit) masked is:\n<sequence_start>w1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0r1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i0w1r1r1i1w0i0i0i1r0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r0i1i0w1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i0w1i1w1i1r1w1i0i0i1i0w1i1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i<sequence_end>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i0i0r0i0i0i1r0w1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0w1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0r1w1r1i1i1i1i1w0r0i0r0r0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0r0r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1w0i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i1i1r1i1i1w0r0r0r0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1w0i0i1i0i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i0i0r\n\nNow, let's find the rightmost 'w' character.
