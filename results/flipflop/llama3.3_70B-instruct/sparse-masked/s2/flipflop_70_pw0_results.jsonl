Finding the rightmost 'w':\n   - The string is scanned from right to left to find the last occurrence of 'w'.\n   - The rightmost 'w' is found at the position before '0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1r'.\n\n2. Identifying the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - The character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n3. Masking the digit:\n   - Replace '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw0i1i0i1i1r0i0w0i0r0i0r0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0w0i0i0w0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i<masked_digit>i0i0i1i1r0i1i1r\n\nHowever, the correct approach should involve finding the last 'w' and then masking the digit immediately after it. Let's correct the process with the actual string manipulation:\n\nInput string: w0i1i0i1i1r0i0w0i0r0i0r0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0w0i0i0w0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in the sequence \"...w0i0i0w0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1r\". The last 'w' is followed by '0'. So, the correct masking should result in:\nw0i1i0i1i1r0i0w0i0r0i0r0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0w0i0i0w<masked_digit>i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1r\n\nThus, the masked sequence is:\n<sequence_start>w0i1i0i1i1r0i0w0i0r0i0r0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0w0i0i0w<masked_digit>i0i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1r<sequence_end>"}
