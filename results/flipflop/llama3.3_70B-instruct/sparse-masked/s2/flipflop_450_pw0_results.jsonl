The rightmost 'w1' in the string is the one I am interested in. \n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is 'w', and the digit after it is '1'. \n\nNow, I replace the '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n<sequence_start>w0i1i0i0r0i1i0r0i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0r0i0i1w1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1w1r1w0w0i0i0i0i1i1w0w0i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i1w1w1r1r1i1i0i1i1i0r1i0r1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i1r1i1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i0w1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1w0i1w0i0i0r0i0w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0w0i0r0i1i0w0i1i0r0i0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0w1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1r1r1w0r</sequence_end> is incorrect because the last 'w' followed by a digit was not found.\n\nLet me re-examine the string to find the last 'w' followed by a digit.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, I found that the last 'w' followed by a digit is indeed 'w1'. \n\nHere is the correct masked sequence:\nThe last 'w' followed by a digit '1' is in 'w1' and it appears several times.

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that the last 'w' is actually: ...w0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1w0i1i0w0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i0w1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1w1i1r1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is actually part of 'w0' near the end. The digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nNow, I replace '0' with '<masked_digit>':\n...i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r is not the correct position, the correct position is: ...w<masked_digit>...\n\nThe correct masked sequence is the original string with '0' replaced by '<masked_digit>' after the rightmost 'w':\n<sequence_start>w1i1r1i0i0i1i0w1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0r1i0i1i0w1i0r1i1i1r1w0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1w0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i0w0r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0w0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i0i1w1i1i1i0i1i1w1i1i1i0i0i1r1i0i0r1i1i1i1i1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0w0r0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i1w1i1i0i1r1w0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1w0i1i0w0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i0w1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1w1i1r1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r is incorrect, the correct sequence is \nw1i1r1i0i0i1i0w1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0r1i0i1i0w1i0r1i1i1r1w0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1w0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i0w0r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0w0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i0i1w1i1i1i0i1i1w1i1i1i0i0i1r1i0i0r1i1i1i1i1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0w0r0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i0r0i0i1i1i0i0i1w1i1i0i1r1w0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r0r0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1w0i1i0w0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i0w1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1w1i1r1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r becomes \nw1i1r1i0i0i1i0w1i0r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0r1i0i1i0w1i0r1i1i1r1w0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1w0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i0w0r0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0w0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i0i1w1i1i1i0i1i1w1i1i1i0i0i1r1i0i0r1i1i1i1i1i0r1i<sequence_end>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw1i0r1i0i0i1i1i1w1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1w1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1w1i0i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i1i1w0i0i1r0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0r0i1r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0w1r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0w1i0i1i0i0i0i0w1i0r1i1i1w0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0w0i1r0i1i0i0w1i1i1i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0w0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i0i0r0r\n\nNow, let's find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string: ...w0i1i1r0i0i1i1r0i0i0r0r. The digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nTo mask this digit, I will replace it with the '<masked_digit>' tag.
