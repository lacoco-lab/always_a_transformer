The second last 'w' is also not followed by any digit as it is the last 'w' in the string. However, upon re-examining the string, we find that there is indeed a 'w' followed by a digit: ...w1... and another ...w0... before the last 'w'. The last 'w' that is followed by a digit is 'w1' which appears before the last 'w' in the string.\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit after the rightmost 'w' that has a digit after it.\n\nThe digit after 'w1' is '1'.\n\nStep 3: Replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' (that has a digit after it) replaced is: \nw1i0r1i1w1i1i0w1r1i1i0w0i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0r0w0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0w1r1i0i1i0r1i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i0i1w0r0w1r1i0i0w0i0r0r0w1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r\n\nHowever, the last 'w' that has a digit after it is 'w1' and its position needs to be found to mask the digit '1' after it.\n\nUpon re-examining, we find 'w1' at: ...i0w1i1i1i1i1... and the last 'w1' before the end of the string is at: ...w1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i0i1w0r0w1r1i0i0w0i0r0r0w1...\n\nSo the correct position to mask is the '1' after 'w1' in '...w1i1i1i1i1i0...'.\n\nThus, the correct masked sequence is: \n<sequence_start>w1i0r1i1w1i1i0w1r1i1i0w0i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0r0w0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0w1r1i0i1i0r1i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0w1<masked_digit>i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i0i1w0r0w1r1i0i0w0i0r0r0w1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r<sequence_end>"}

The correct approach to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w' involves directly modifying the original string at the specified position.\n\nGiven the string and the task, the rightmost 'w' is indeed at the position before the last '1' in the sequence ...i0i0w1i0i0i1r.

Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after this 'w' character.\n3. Replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the algorithmic solution:\n\nInput string: w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i1i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0w1r1i1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r0w0r0w1r1r1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1r\n\nStep 1: Find the rightmost 'w' character.\n\nAfter examining the string, the rightmost 'w' is found at the very end of the string: ...i1i1i0i1r\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is the last character in the string, but since it's at the end, there's no digit after it to mask. However, upon re-examining the task, it seems the instruction is to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w' if it exists. Given the string ends with '...i1i1i0i1r', the actual last 'w' before this sequence is not at the very end but somewhere before. Let's correct this:\n\nThe correct sequence to consider for the rightmost 'w' before the end of the string is: ...w1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1r\n\nThus, the rightmost 'w' that has a digit after it is indeed 'w1' in '...w1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1r'.\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after this 'w' character.\n\nThe digit after 'w' in 'w1' is '1'.\n\nStep 3: Replace this digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nSo, 'w1' becomes 'w<masked_digit>'.\n\nNow, let's apply this change to the original string:\n\nOriginal string: w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i1i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0w1r1i1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r0w0r0w1r1r1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1r\n\nModified string: w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w<masked_digit>i0i1i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0w1r1i1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r0w0r0w1r1r1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1r\n\nHowever, the correct replacement should be in the sequence where 'w1' appears before the end of the string and has a digit '1' after it, which upon re-examination, is actually not the case as described. The error was in identifying the correct 'w' followed by a digit to mask. The correct approach should involve finding the last 'w' that is not at the end of the string and then masking the digit after it. \n\nGiven the complexity and the mistake in the initial explanation, let's clarify:\n\nThe task requires finding the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit and then masking that digit. The correct sequence to look for is 'w' followed by a digit, and then mask that digit.\n\nUpon a detailed review, the correct 'w' to consider for masking the following digit is indeed in a sequence where 'w' is followed by a digit. The mistake was in the identification and explanation process.\n\nTo simplify and correct the approach:\n\n1. The input string is: w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w1i0i1i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0w1r1i1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r0w0r0w1r1r1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1r\n\n2. Find the rightmost 'w' that has a digit after it.\n\n3. Mask the digit after this 'w'.\n\nGiven the error in the step-by-step process and to directly address the task:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' followed by a digit in the given string is actually part of the sequence 'w1' which appears multiple times. The task is to mask the '1' in the last occurrence of 'w1' before the end of the string where 'w' is followed by a digit.\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w<masked_digit>i0i1i1w1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0w1r1i1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i0i0w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r0w0r0w1r1r1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i1w1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i0i1r<sequence_end>"}
