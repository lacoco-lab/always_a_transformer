After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, but since there are multiple 'w's at the end, I will consider the last 'w' that is not followed by another 'w'. However, in this case, the last 'w' is indeed the rightmost 'w' and it is followed by a '0'.\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. I will replace this '0' with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n<sequence_start>w0i1i1i1i1i0r0i0r0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1w0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1w0w0i1i0i0r0i0i0w1r1i0i1r1w0i1i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i1w0i1i1i1r0i0i0w0i0i0i0r0i0r0i1i1i1i1i0i0w0i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0w0r0i0r0i0i0r0w<masked_digit></sequence_end>\n\nHowever, the above approach does not correctly identify the rightmost 'w' that is not part of a sequence of 'w's at the end. Let's re-evaluate the string to correctly identify the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit and not part of a sequence of 'w's at the end.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, the correct rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is actually \"w1\" which appears before the last sequence of 'w's and digits.
