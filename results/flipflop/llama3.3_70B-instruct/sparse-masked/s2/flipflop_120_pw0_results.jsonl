Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\nInput: w0i0i0r0i1i1r0i1w1i0r1i1i1w1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1w0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1r\n\nStep 1: Find the rightmost 'w' character.\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the position where 'w' appears last in the string.\n\nStep 2 & 3: \nAfter examining the string, the rightmost 'w' is found to be at the end of the sequence \"i1i1i1i0r1i1r\". The digit immediately after this 'w' is '1'. \n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of the original task, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis because the task explicitly asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Given the correct identification of the rightmost 'w' and the subsequent digit, the correct approach involves directly replacing this digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nGiven the input string and the task, the rightmost 'w' is indeed followed by a '1'. Thus, the correct masking involves replacing this '1' with <masked_digit>.\n\nHere is the corrected approach with the actual masking:\n\nThe input string with the rightmost 'w' followed by '1' is: ...i0i0i0w1...\n\nThe masked sequence should replace the '1' after the rightmost 'w' with <masked_digit>, resulting in: ...i0i0i0w<masked_digit>...\n\nGiven the entire input string and performing the replacement as described:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0r0i1i1r0i1w1i0r1i1i1w1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1w0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i1i1i1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1r</sequence_start> is incorrect because it does not include the masking.\n\nCorrecting for the masking as per the task:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in \"w1i1i1i1i1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1r\". The digit after it is '1'. So, the correct masking should result in \"w<masked_digit>i1i1i1i1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1r\".\n\nThus, the entire string with the correct masking is:\nw0i0i0r0i1i1r0i1w1i0r1i1i1w1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1w0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0w<masked_digit>i1i1i1i1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1r\n\nTherefore, the masked sequence, enclosed within the specified tags, is:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0i0r0i1i1r0i1w1i0r1i1i1w1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1w0r0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0w<masked_digit>i1i1i1i1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1r</sequence_end><sequence_end>"}
