The correct position of the last 'w' is before '1' in 'w1i1i1w'. \n\nSo, the correct masked sequence is:\n<sequence_start>w1i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0w1i1i1i1r1i1i1w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1w1i1i0i0i0i1i0w1i1i1i1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i1i1r1i1w0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i1w0r0i1w1i1i1w<masked_digit>i1i1w</sequence_end>\n\nThis is the final masked sequence.<sequence_end>"}
