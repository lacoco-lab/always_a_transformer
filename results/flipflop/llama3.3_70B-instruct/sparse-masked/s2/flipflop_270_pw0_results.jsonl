However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', which in this case is '1'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\nThe digit '1' after the rightmost 'w' should be replaced with <masked_digit>.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0w0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1w0i1i1r0i1r0i1i1i0w0i0i0r0r0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0r0i1i0i1r0w1i0i0i1i0i0r1w1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i0w0i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r0r0w1w1r1i0i1i1r1r1i0r1i0i1i0i0i1i1r</sequence_end> is incorrect because the last '1' was not masked.\n\nCorrecting the above response:\nThe correct masking should be applied to the last '1' after the last 'w'.

After examining the string, we find that the last 'w' is followed by a '0'. \n\nSo, the digit to be masked is '0', and it will be replaced with <masked_digit>.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i1w0i0i1i0i1i1w0i1r0i1i0i0i1i1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i0i0i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0w0r0i0i0i0w0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i0i1i0r1r0w<masked_digit>i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0w0r0i0i0i0w0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i0i1i0r1r</sequence_end>\n\nHowever, upon re-examining my approach for accuracy in following the instructions to the letter as requested, I realized the explanation provided does not directly lead to the correct masking as per the task's requirement due to an oversight in identifying the correct position of the last 'w' and the subsequent digit to be masked. \n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precision in identifying the rightmost 'w' and the digit that follows it for masking, let's correct the approach and directly apply it to the given string:\n\nThe correct sequence with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is found by accurately locating the last 'w' in the string and then replacing the digit immediately following it with <masked_digit>.\n\nUpon careful examination, the last 'w' in the string is actually followed by a '0'. Thus, the correct masking should replace this '0' with <masked_digit>.\n\nHere is the corrected output with the rightmost 'w' followed by the digit masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i1w0i0i1i0i1i1w0i1r0i1i0i0i1i1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i0i0i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0w0r0i0i0i0w0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i0i1i0r1r0w<masked_digit>...</sequence_end>\n\nHowever, the accurate masking requires identifying the last 'w' and ensuring the digit immediately after it is correctly replaced. Given the string's complexity, the focus should be on the last occurrence of 'w' and the immediate digit after it for masking.\n\nTo simplify and correct my approach for clarity and adherence to the task:\n\nThe input string is: w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i1w0i0i1i0i1i1w0i1r0i1i0i0i1i1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i0i0i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0w0r0i0i0i0w0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i0i1i0r1r\n\nThe last 'w' is before the last set of characters. The correct masking involves finding this 'w' and replacing the digit after it with <masked_digit>.\n\nGiven the string and the need to mask the digit after the last 'w', the correct output should directly reflect this replacement.\n\nThus, the final masked sequence, considering the last 'w' and the digit that follows it for masking, should be presented as follows, ensuring the digit immediately after the last 'w' is correctly identified and masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i0i1w0i0i1i0i1i1w0i1r0i1i0i0i1i1w1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i0i0i0w0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0<sequence_end>"}
