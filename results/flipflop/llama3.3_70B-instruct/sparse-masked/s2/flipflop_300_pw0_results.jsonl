Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the input string:\nw0i1i1i0i1i0w0w0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i1w1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0i0i0r1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i0r1r1i1i1i0i1w1r1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0w1i1i1r1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w0i0i1i1w0w0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1r0i1i0i1r0r\n\nFirst, I find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"...i0i1r0r\" is not correct, the correct 'w' is before the last set of characters.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is actually: ...w0w0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1r0i1i0i1r0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is before the '0' in the sequence: ...w0...\n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. \n\nNow, I replace this '0' with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nThe modified string is:\nw0i1i1i0i1i0w0w0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i1w1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0i0i0r1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i0r1r1i1i1i0i1w1r1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0w1i1i1r1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w0i0i1i1w0w0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1r0i1i0i1r0<masked_digit>\n\nHowever, the correct replacement should be made in the original string, not at the end. The correct sequence after the replacement is:\nw0i1i1i0i1i0w0w0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i1i1w1i0i1r1i1i0i0i0i0i0r1i0i0r1i1i0i1i0r1i1i1i0r1r1i1i1i0i1w1r1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0w1i1i1r1r1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w0i0i1i1w0<masked_digit>i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1r0i1i0i1r0r\n\nHere is the masked sequence between the <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}

We need to find the last occurrence of 'w' followed by a digit and mask the digit.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the string to find the last 'w' followed by a digit and mask it.\n\nUpon re-evaluation, the correct output is:\n\n<sequence_start>\nw0i0i1r0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1w0r0i0i1r0i0r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0w1w1r1i1i0w0i0i0i1r0i0r0i1i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w0r0w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1w0i0r0w0w0i0i0i1i1i0r is incorrect. The correct string to be evaluated for the last 'w' is: \nw0i0i1r0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1w0r0i0i1r0i0r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0w1w1r1i1i0w0i0i0i1r0i0r0i1i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w0r0w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1w0i0r0w0w0i0i0i1i1i0r\n\nThe last 'w' followed by a digit is indeed 'w0'. The correct masked sequence should replace the last '0' after 'w' with <masked_digit>.\n\nThe correct sequence after masking the last digit after 'w' is:\nw0i0i1r0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1w0r0i0i1r0i0r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0w1w1r1i1i0w0i0i0i1r0i0r0i1i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1w0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1w0r0w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1w0i0r0w0w0i0i0i1i1i0r\n\nThe last 'w0' in the string is the one to be replaced. The correct replacement is:\nw<masked_digit>i0i1r0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i<sequence_end>"}
