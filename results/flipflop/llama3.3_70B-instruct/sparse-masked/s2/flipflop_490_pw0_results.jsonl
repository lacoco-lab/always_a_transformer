After finding it, we replace the next character (which is a digit) with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the corrected approach:\n\n1. Find the last 'w' in the string.\n2. The digit after this 'w' is '1'.\n3. Replace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe corrected sequence with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\n\n<sequence_start>w1r1w1i1i1i1i1r1i0r1i1w1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1w1i1i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i1i0w0i0i0i1i0i1i1r0i1i0i1i0i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1w0i0w0i0r0i1i1r0w0r0i0i1i0i1w1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0r1i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0w0i1i1i0i0i0r0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0w0i0i0i1i0i0w0i0r0i0i1i0i0w1i1i1w1i0i0i0i0i0r1i0r1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i0r1r1w0i1i1i0i0i1i0r0i0i1w0i0w0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1r0w1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0r1w0i1r0i0i1i1w1i1w1i1i1r1i1w1i0i0i0i0i1w1i1r1i0i0r1i0r1i0r1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1r</sequence_start>\n\nGiven the complexity of manually finding and replacing the digit after the last 'w' in such a long string, the explanation provided earlier outlines the steps to achieve the task. However, to accurately complete the task as requested, the correct output with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked should be directly provided after performing the operation.\n\nGiven the string and the task, the rightmost 'w' is found, and the digit immediately after it is '1'. Thus, the correct masking involves replacing this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<sequence_start>w1r1w1i1i1i1i1r1i0r1i1w1i0i0r1r1i0i1i1w<sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string.\n\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'. However, since it's at the end of the string, there's no digit after it to mask. But to follow the instruction precisely and given the nature of the task, I will consider the '0' right before the 'r' at the end as the digit to be masked because it's the last 'w' in the sequence and there's no digit after it to mask. The correct approach, given the task's specifics and the input provided, is to identify the last occurrence of 'w' and then look for the digit that immediately follows it. In this case, since 'w' is followed by '0' and then 'r', the digit to be masked is indeed '0'.\n\nHere is the masked sequence:\n<sequence_start>w1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i1i0r1i1i0r1i0i1w1i0i0i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1w0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1i1i0i0r0i0r0i1i0i0r0w0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0w0r0i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i1i1i0i1i0r0r0i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i1i1i1w0i1i1w0i0i0i0i0r0i1i1w0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1w0i0w0r0i1i1i0i0w1i1i1r1i0i1i1i0i0i1w1i1w1i0i1i1r1i1w1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0w<masked_digit>r<sequence_end>"}

The rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string.\n\nNext, I identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character. Since the 'w' is at the end of the string, there is no digit after it. However, I will consider the 'w' that is second to the rightmost, which is 'w0' near the end of the string.\n\nThe digit immediately after this 'w' is '0'. I will replace this '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1w0i0i0w0i0i1r0w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0w1i1i0i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0w0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i1w1r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1i0i1w0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i0r0w1w1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0r1i1w1i1r1i0i1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0r1i0i1i1i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i1i1w0r0i0r0i1i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1w0i1<masked_digit></sequence_end>\n\nHowever, the above solution does not seem right as the 'w' considered is not the rightmost 'w'. Let's re-evaluate the string to find the rightmost 'w'. \n\nUpon re-evaluation, I found that the rightmost 'w' is indeed 'w0' near the end of the string, but there is another 'w' after it, which is 'w1r'. The rightmost 'w' in 'w1r' is the actual rightmost 'w' in the string.\n\nThe digit immediately after this 'w' is '1'. I will replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1w0i0i0w0i0i1r0w0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i1i0w1i1i0i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0w0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i1w1r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1i0i1w0i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0i1r0i0i1i0r0w1w1i1r1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0r1i1w1i1r1i0i1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0r1i0r1i0i1i1i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i1r0i0i0i0i1i1i1w0r0i0r0i1i1r0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i1i1i0i0i1i1r0i0i0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1w0i<masked_digit>r</sequence_end><sequence_end>"}
