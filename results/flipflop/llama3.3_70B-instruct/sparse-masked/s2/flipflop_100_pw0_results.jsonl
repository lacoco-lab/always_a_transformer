Identifying the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - After finding the rightmost 'w', the next character is checked.\n   - If the next character is a digit, it is identified for masking.\n\nLet's perform these steps on the given input string:\n\nInput: w0w0i1i1r0i0w0i0i1i0r0i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is the last 'w' in the string. Upon inspection, the last 'w' is followed by '0'. \n\nSo, the digit to be masked is '0', and it will be replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw0w0i1i1r0i0w0i0i1i0r0i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0\n\nSince the last 'w' is followed by '0', the correct masking would result in:\nw0w0i1i1r0i0w0i0i1i0r0i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0<masked_digit>\n\nHowever, the correct approach should involve finding the actual last 'w' and then masking the digit immediately after it.

Therefore, the last digit '0' after the last 'w' should be masked.\n\nGiven this, the correct masking should result in the last '0' after 'w' being replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the corrected approach to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precision in identifying the rightmost 'w' and the subsequent digit, the task requires a careful examination of the string from right to left to accurately locate the last 'w' and the digit that immediately follows it.\n\nUpon careful examination and applying the rules for masking the digit after the rightmost 'w', the correct output with the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
