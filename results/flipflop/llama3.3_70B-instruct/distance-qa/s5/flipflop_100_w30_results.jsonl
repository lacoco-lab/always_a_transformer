Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the string: w1i1i0i0r1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1i0i1r1w1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1r1i1r1i1i0r1r\n\nStep 1: The rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"r1w1...\". No, it's not. Looking closely, the string actually ends with \"...i1r1i1i0r1r\", and there's a 'w' before the last set of characters: \"...r1w1i0r1...\". So, the rightmost 'w' is in \"...r1w1...\".\n\nStep 2: The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n3. Determine if this character is '0' or '1'.\n\nGiven the string: w1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i1i1r1i0i1w1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1i1i1i1i0r1r1i1i0r1i1i0i1r1r\n\nFirst, let's find the rightmost 'w'. The string can be scanned from right to left to find the last occurrence of 'w'.\n\nUpon scanning, we find that the rightmost 'w' is near the end: ...r1i1i0r1i1i0i1r1r\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is not present in the last few characters as shown, we need to look a bit more to the left in the original string to find it: ...i0i1w1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1i1i1i1i0r1r1i1i0r1i1i0i1r1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is actually: ...i0i1w...\n\nNow, looking at the character immediately to the right of this 'w', we find: ...i0i1w1...\n\nThe character immediately after 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
