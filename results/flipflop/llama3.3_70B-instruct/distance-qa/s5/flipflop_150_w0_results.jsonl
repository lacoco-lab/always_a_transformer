But since the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w' and there's only one 'w' at the start, the question seems to be testing the understanding of \"rightmost\" in a sequence. Given the sequence provided and the fact that there's no other 'w' than the one at the start, the question might be seen as slightly misleading because it implies a search for a 'w' that is not there (beyond the first character).\n\nHowever, following the instruction to the letter as requested, and considering the \"rightmost 'w'\" to be the 'w' at the beginning of the string since it's the only 'w' present, the digit immediately after this 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

However, given the instruction, it seems we are to consider the 'w' as a starting point and look for the pattern that follows.\n\nThe string provided is: w1r1i0i0i1i1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0i1i0r1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1r1i0i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i1i0i1i1r1i0i0i1r1i0r1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r\n\nGiven the 'w' is at the start, the digit immediately after it is '1'. However, the question seems to be asking for a different interpretation, possibly due to a misunderstanding of \"right most 'w' character\" in a string where 'w' appears only once at the beginning. \n\nIf we were to follow the instruction literally and consider the \"right most 'w'\" in a scenario where multiple 'w's are present (which is not the case here), we'd still look for the last occurrence of 'w' and then find the digit after it. But since 'w' is singular and at the start, the immediate digit after 'w' is '1'.\n\nThus, based on the provided options and the literal interpretation of the task as it might be applied to a string with multiple 'w's (though not applicable here), the correct answer, following the exact wording of the task and the provided options, should reflect the digit immediately after the 'w' in the given string, which is '1'. \n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Since there's only one 'w' in the given string, which is at the beginning, we look at the string from left to right to identify the pattern and find the digit immediately following the 'w'. However, given the instruction, it seems we are to consider the 'w' as a fixed starting point and look for the pattern that follows.\n\nThe string provided is: w1r1i0i0r1i0i1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1i0r1i0r1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i0r1i0r\n\nGiven the 'w' is at the start, the digit immediately after it is '1'. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', which implies looking for a 'w' that is not present elsewhere in the string except at the beginning. Thus, the question seems to be testing the understanding of \"rightmost\" in the context of a single occurrence of 'w'. \n\nSince there's no 'w' other than the first character, and the question specifically asks for the digit after the \"rightmost 'w'\", we consider the immediate next character after 'w', which is '1'. \n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
