If we're looking for the digit immediately after the only 'w' in the string, it's '1'. But since '1' is not an option and considering the phrasing of the question, there seems to be a confusion in interpreting the task.\n\nGiven the options and the context, if we strictly follow the instruction to find the digit after the 'w' (considering 'w' as a singular occurrence at the start), the immediate digit after 'w' is indeed '1', which corresponds to option B.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
