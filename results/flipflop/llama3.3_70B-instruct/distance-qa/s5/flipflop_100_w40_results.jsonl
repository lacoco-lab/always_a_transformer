However, since 'w' is followed by no characters, we must consider the option that directly follows 'w' in the sequence given, which is '0' as per \"w0\" in the string before the last 'w'. But since the task specifically asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w', and there's no digit after the last 'w' because it's the last character, the question seems to be probing for an understanding of \"rightmost\" in a sequence. \n\nHowever, given the structure of the question and the options provided, it seems the intent might be to identify the digit following the last occurrence of 'w' in a sequence where 'w' is not the last character but is part of a pattern. In the sequence provided, before the last 'w', we see \"w0\", indicating a pattern where 'w' is followed by '0'. \n\nThus, based on the pattern observed and the way the question is framed, the answer would lean towards the digit '0' as it directly follows 'w' in the pattern observed before the last 'w'. \n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
