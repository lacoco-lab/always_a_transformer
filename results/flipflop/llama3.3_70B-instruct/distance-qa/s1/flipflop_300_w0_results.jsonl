Since there's only one 'w' in the given string, which is at the beginning, we look at the string from left to right to identify the pattern and find the digit immediately following the 'w' is not what we're looking for. Instead, we need to understand the question asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w', but since there's only one 'w' and it's at the start, the question seems to be testing the understanding of \"rightmost\" in a string with a single occurrence of 'w'. \n\nHowever, given the nature of the task, it seems we are to take the 'w' as a starting point and look for patterns or the question might be misleading due to its wording. If we consider the task as looking for a pattern or the next digit after any 'w' in a general sense, we'd still be looking at the start of the string due to the singular 'w'. The first character after 'w' is '1', but this doesn't align with the options provided (A. 0 or B. 1) in the context of looking for a digit after the 'w' in a manner that suggests an evaluation of the string's content following the 'w'. \n\nGiven the literal interpretation that we're looking for the digit immediately after the 'w' and considering the provided options, the correct approach is to simply look at the first character after 'w', which is '1'.

Since there's only one 'w' in the given string, which is at the beginning, we look at the string starting from the end to find the last 'w' and then move one character to the right. However, given the 'w' is at the start, we simply look at the character immediately following 'w', which is '1'. But since the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w' and there are no other 'w's, the question seems to be testing the understanding of \"rightmost\" in a string where 'w' appears only once at the start.\n\nGiven the string structure and the question's phrasing, it seems there might be confusion. The rightmost 'w' is the only 'w', and it's at the beginning, followed by '1'. If we were to interpret the question as looking for a pattern or additional 'w's (which are not present), we'd still conclude the first character after 'w' is '1'. \n\nHowever, considering the intent might be to identify a digit following a 'w' in a scenario where 'w' could appear multiple times (though it doesn't here), and given there's no 'w' other than the first character, the direct answer based on the provided string would relate to the character immediately after 'w', which is '1'.

Since there's only one 'w' in the given string, which is at the beginning, we look at the string from the end to find the last 'w' is actually the first character. However, the task implies finding the digit immediately after the 'w', considering 'w' as a reference point in a general sense. Given 'w' is the first character, the digit immediately after it is '1'. But since the question specifically asks for the digit after the **right most** 'w', and there's only one 'w' which is at the start, the question seems to be testing the understanding of \"right most\" in a sequence. \n\nGiven the sequence and the instruction, the rightmost 'w' is still the first character because there's no other 'w' to compare with.
