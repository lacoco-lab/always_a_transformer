The string starts with a 'w' and ends with a series of characters that do not include 'w' until we find the last 'w' which is not at the beginning but somewhere in the middle. Upon closer inspection, we see there are only two 'w's, one at the start and one in the middle. The rightmost 'w' is thus the second 'w' in the string.\n\nThe string with the rightmost 'w' highlighted (for clarity, let's say it's around the middle, but we need to find the exact position):\n...i1r0w0i1i0r0r0i0r0r0i1i0i0r0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i0i0i1r0r0i1i1r0i1i0i0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0r0i0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i0i1i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0i1i0i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is followed by '0'. \n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
