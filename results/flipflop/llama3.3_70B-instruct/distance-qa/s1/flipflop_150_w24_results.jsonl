The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string \"w0r0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1r0i0r\" which is not correct since there are more characters before the last 'w'. The correct string to look at is the entire string, and upon inspection, we see the last 'w' is actually in \"...r0w0r0...\". So, the rightmost 'w' is in this position.\n\n2. Looking at the character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w', we find '0'.\n\n3. This character is '0', which corresponds to option A.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
