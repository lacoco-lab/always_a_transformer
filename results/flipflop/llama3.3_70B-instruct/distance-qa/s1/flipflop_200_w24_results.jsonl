Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\nThe given string is: w1i1i1r1r1i1r1i1r1i0i0i1w0r0i0r0i0i1i0i1r0i1i0r0i1i1r0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i1i0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0r\n\nFirst, let's find the rightmost 'w'. To do this, we can start from the end of the string and move towards the beginning until we find a 'w'. \n\nUpon inspecting the string from right to left, the rightmost 'w' is found near the end: ...i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0r\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is not visible in this last part of the string, which means we have to look at the string more closely from the end to find it. \n\nUpon closer inspection of the entire string from the end, we find: ...r0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0r\n\nThe 'w' is actually located before this part of the string. Let's look more carefully: ...i1r0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0r\n\nAnd before this part: ...0r0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i1i0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0i1i1r0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0r0i1r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0r0r0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i0r0r\n\nFinally, looking at the string from the beginning to ensure we find the rightmost 'w', we see that there are only two 'w's in the entire string: one at the very beginning and one in the middle. The rightmost 'w' is thus in the middle, followed by '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
