However, the task implies finding the 'w' and then looking at what comes after it, but since 'w' is the first character, we consider the entire string for the context of finding a pattern or additional 'w's. Given there are no more 'w's, the question seems to be about understanding the sequence or pattern, but it directly asks for the digit after the 'w', which would be '1' since the string starts with 'w1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Since there's only one 'w' in the given string, which is at the beginning, we look at the string from left to right to identify the pattern and find the digit immediately following the 'w' is not what we're looking for. Instead, we need to understand the question asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w', but since there's only one 'w' and it's at the start, the question seems to be testing the understanding of \"rightmost\" in a string with a single occurrence of 'w'. \n\nHowever, given the nature of the question, it seems to be asking for a digit after a 'w' that appears later in the sequence, but since 'w' appears only once at the start, the question might be considered flawed or based on a misunderstanding. \n\nBut, if we consider the intent might be to find the pattern or the digit following the sequence after 'w', we still only have one 'w' followed by '1'. Thus, the digit immediately after 'w' in the sequence given is '1'. \n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
