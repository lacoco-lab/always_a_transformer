However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', implying we should consider the 'w' as a reference point and look for any 'w's that might appear later in the string, but since there are no more 'w's, the initial 'w' is our point of reference.\n\nGiven the structure of the task, it seems to imply a search for a pattern or multiple occurrences, but in this case, it's straightforward: the 'w' is followed by '1', and there are no other 'w's to consider. Thus, the digit immediately after the 'w' (which is the only 'w' and also the rightmost due to being the sole occurrence) is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
