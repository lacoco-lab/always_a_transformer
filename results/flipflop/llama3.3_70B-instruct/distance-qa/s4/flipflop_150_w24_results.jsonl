The string after the second 'w' is \"1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i1i1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i1i0r1i0i1r1i0i0i1r1i0r1i0r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1i1i0i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r\".\n\nThe character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
