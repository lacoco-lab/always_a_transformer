Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the string: w0r0i1r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1w0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0i0r0r0i0r0i0i0r0i0i0r0i0r\n\nFirst, let's find the rightmost 'w'. The string can be scanned from right to left to find the last occurrence of 'w'. Upon scanning, we find that the rightmost 'w' is near the end of the string: ...r0i0i0r0i0i0r0i0r is followed by the last part of the string which contains 'w': w0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0i0r0r0i0r0i0i0r0i0i0r0i0r. The 'w' in question is the one just before \"0r0r0r0r0r0i1...\".\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is followed by '0'. \n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
