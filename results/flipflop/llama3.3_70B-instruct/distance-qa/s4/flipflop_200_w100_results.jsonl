Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the \"Input\" string:\nw1r1r1i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1i1i0i1r1i1i0r1r1i1i1r1i0i0r1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1i0i0i1r1i1r1r1w1r1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i0r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1i0i1r1i1i0i1r1i0r1r1r1r\n\nStarting from the right end of the string and moving left, we find the first 'w' which is the rightmost 'w'. The string ends with \"...r1r1r1r\", and moving left, we find \"r1w1...\". \n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is in \"r1w1\". The character immediately to the right of 'w' in \"r1w1\" is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
