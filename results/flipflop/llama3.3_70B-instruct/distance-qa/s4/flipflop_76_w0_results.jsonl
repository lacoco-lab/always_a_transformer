Since there's only one 'w' in the given string, which is at the beginning, we look at the string from left to right to identify the pattern and find the digit immediately following 'w'. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', implying we should consider the string's structure and the 'w' placement.\n\nGiven the string starts with \"w1...\", the 'w' is followed by '1'. But to ensure we're addressing the question correctly, let's break it down:\n\n1. Identify 'w' in the string: It's at the start.\n2. The question asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Since there's only one 'w' and it's the first character, we look at what immediately follows it.\n\nThe string is \"w1r1r1...\". Thus, the digit immediately after 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
