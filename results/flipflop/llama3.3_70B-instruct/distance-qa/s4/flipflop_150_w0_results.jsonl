The digit immediately after 'w' is '1', but '1' is not an option provided. The options are '0' or '1' as answers, but given the direct interpretation of the question, none of these options directly apply because the immediate character after 'w' is '1', not '0' or an option that matches the provided choices directly in the context of being after a 'w' that is not at the start.\n\nHowever, strictly following the provided options and the question's possible implication of looking for a digit in a sequence where 'w' might be considered in a different context or sequence, and considering the confusion in the explanation:\n\nThe correct approach should directly address the question without overcomplicating it: The character after 'w' is '1', but since '1' is not directly offered as an explanation in the choices provided (A or B), and considering the aim is to select from the given options based on the question's possible misinterpretation or simplification:\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

However, the question asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', and since 'w' is only mentioned once at the start, the digit immediately following 'w' is '1', but '1' is not among the provided options. The confusion arises from the interpretation of the task. Given the options and the context, it seems the task is to identify the pattern or the specific digit following 'w' based on the provided choices (A. 0 or B. 1), but since 'w' is not repeated, the direct answer based on the given string and the usual interpretation would not align with the options provided as the immediate character after 'w' is '1', which is not what's being asked given the context of the options.\n\nHowever, considering the structure of the question and the options provided (A. 0 or B. 1), and understanding that the task might be aiming at a different level of interpretation or there might have been an oversight in the question's construction, the direct and literal interpretation based on standard reading would not apply as expected. \n\nGiven the literal interpretation and the provided options, and acknowledging the potential for misunderstanding in the question's intent, the task as stated does not directly apply to the given scenario in a way that matches the expected outcome based on the options. \n\nBut, to follow the instruction as closely as possible and given that '1' is the character immediately after 'w' and it matches one of the digits mentioned in the options indirectly:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
