However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', which implies looking for a 'w' that is not at the start since the start 'w' is the only 'w' and thus is both the leftmost and rightmost. The confusion arises from the phrasing of the task. \n\nSince there's no 'w' other than the one at the beginning, and the task seems to be asking for a digit following a 'w' that appears later in the string (which does not exist), the question's premise seems flawed based on standard interpretations of \"rightmost.\" However, if we're to take the question at face value and consider the \"rightmost 'w'\" as the 'w' that is present (at the start), the digit immediately after this 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Since there's only one 'w' in the given string, which is at the beginning, we look at the string from left to right to identify the pattern and find the digit immediately following the 'w'. However, given the instruction, it seems we are to consider the 'w' as a fixed starting point and look for the pattern that follows.\n\nThe string provided is: w1i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0r1i0i1r1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1i1i0r1i1r1r1i1i0i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1i1i1i1i0r1i1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i0i0r1i1i1r\n\nGiven the 'w' is at the start, the digit immediately after it is '1'. However, the question seems to be asking for a different interpretation, possibly due to a misunderstanding of \"right most 'w' character\" in a string where 'w' appears only once at the beginning. \n\nIf we strictly follow the given instruction without overcomplicating it, the digit right after the 'w' (which is the only 'w' and it's at the beginning) is '1'. \n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', which implies looking for a pattern or the 'w' in a different context than provided. Since there's no other 'w' than the one at the beginning, and no clear repeating pattern that includes 'w' to apply the instruction directly, we must infer the question intends to test understanding of the string's provided content directly after 'w', which is '1'. \n\nThus, the correct answer, based on the information given and the direct interpretation of the task, is:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
