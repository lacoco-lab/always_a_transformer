The rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w...r\" (the last 'w' before the string ends).\n2. The character immediately to the right of the last 'w' does not exist because 'w' is the last character, but since we are looking for the digit after 'w' and there's no character after the last 'w', we should consider the context of the question. However, following the instruction strictly, there is no digit after the rightmost 'w' because 'w' is the last character in the string. \n\nGiven the context, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation. If we are to choose based on the presence of 'w' followed by a digit in the string (not necessarily at the very end), the last occurrence of 'w' followed by a digit is \"w0\". \n\nThus, based on the logic of finding a 'w' followed by a digit within the string (since the 'w' at the very end does not have a following digit), the answer would be:\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
