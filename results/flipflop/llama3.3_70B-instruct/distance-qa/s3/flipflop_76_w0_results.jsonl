Since there's only one 'w' in the given string, which is at the beginning, we look at the string from left to right to identify the pattern and find the 'w'. The string starts with 'w', followed by a series of digits and characters.\n\nGiven the string: w1i1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1i1i0i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i0i1i1r1r1r1r\n\nThe 'w' is at the start, so the character immediately after 'w' is '1'. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', and since 'w' appears only once and is the first character, '1' is indeed the digit immediately following 'w'. \n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
