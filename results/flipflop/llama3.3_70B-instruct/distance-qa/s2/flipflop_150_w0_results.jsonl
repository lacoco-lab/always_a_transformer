Since the string provided is quite long and starts with 'w', we'll search from the end of the string towards the beginning to find the last occurrence of 'w'.\n\nUpon inspecting the string from right to left, we notice that 'w' appears only at the beginning of the string. Therefore, the rightmost 'w' is actually the first character of the string.\n\nThe character immediately after 'w' is '0'. \n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', and since there's only one 'w' and it's at the start, the question might be slightly misunderstood.
