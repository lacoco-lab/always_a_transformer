No, it's not.

The 'w's are actually in these positions: \"w0r...\" at the beginning and another 'w' after some characters \"...r0w...\". \n\nThe correct approach is to start from the end of the string and move backwards to find the first 'w', which would be the rightmost 'w'. \n\nGiven the complexity and my initial misinterpretation, let's simplify:\n\nThe string starts with \"w0...\" and has another 'w' later. The task is to find the digit after the last 'w'. \n\nStarting from the end and moving backwards, we find that the last 'w' is actually followed by a \"0\" because the string's relevant part for our search is \"...r0w0r0r0r0r0i0r0i0i0i1i1i1i0r0i0r0i0i1r\" and the 'w' before the last set of characters is indeed followed by a \"0\".\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is \"0\".\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
