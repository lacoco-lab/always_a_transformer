However, given the 'w' is at the start, the task simplifies to finding the character immediately after 'w', which is '1'. But since the question asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w' and there's no 'w' other than the first one, the question essentially asks for the digit immediately following the only 'w' present.\n\nGiven the string starts with \"w1...\", the digit immediately after 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
