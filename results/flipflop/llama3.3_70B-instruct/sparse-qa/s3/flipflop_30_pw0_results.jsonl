Given there's no other 'w', the initial 'w' is our point of reference. The question seems to be asking for a 'w' that appears later in the string, but since there isn't one, we consider the provided 'w' and the immediate digit after it, which is '1'. But, considering the spirit of the question might be looking for a 'w' that is not at the start (even though there isn't one), let's clarify:\n\nIf we were to find a 'w' later in the string and look for the digit after it, we'd follow the same process. But since 'w' is singular and at the start, and no other 'w's are present, the direct answer based on the given string and the singular presence of 'w' at the start would indeed refer to the digit immediately following the only 'w' present, which is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
