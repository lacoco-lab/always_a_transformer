Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n3. Determine if this character is '0' or '1' to choose between options A and B.\n\nGiven the input string, let's perform these steps:\n\nInput: w1i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0w1i0i0r1i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0w1r1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1w0i0i1r0i1i0i1r0i1i0i1w0w0r0i1i1i1i0i1w1r1r1i0i1i1i1i1w1w1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1r1r1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i1r1r1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i1r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r1i1w1i0i0i0i0w1r1w1r1i1r1i0i0w0i1i0i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i1r0i0i0i0i1i0i0w1i1w1i0i0i1r1r1i1i0r1w0r0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"...r1w0r0i0r\". There is no character to the right of the last 'w' in the string, but since the question asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', we look at the last occurrence of 'w' that has a character following it. \n\nUpon reviewing the string again for the last 'w' that has a digit immediately after it, we find \"...i1w1r1...\" and \"...i0w1r1...\". The last 'w' with a digit after it is actually in \"...i0w1r1...\". The digit immediately after 'w1' is 'r', not a digit, indicating an error in my initial step-by-step logic for this specific question context. \n\nCorrecting the approach: The task is to find the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w'. Given the string structure, we should directly identify the last 'w' followed by a digit. However, my explanation mistakenly led to examining 'w' followed by any character, not specifically focusing on 'w' followed by a digit as required.\n\nRe-evaluating the string for the correct 'w' followed by a digit: The correct sequence to look for is 'w' immediately followed by '1' or '0'. The last occurrence of such a sequence is crucial. \n\nGiven the complexity and the error in the initial logic, let's simplify: The question asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. If we look at the string from right to left, we find 'w's followed by various characters. The critical insight is to find the 'w' that has a '1' or '0' immediately after it, which was the intended step.\n\nUpon a detailed review, the error in logic was in not directly pinpointing the last 'w' with a subsequent digit. Given the string's complexity, the focus should be on the last 'w' that directly precedes a '1' or '0'. \n\nGiven this correction need and the specific request for the answer format, let's directly address the query with the proper analysis outcome:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
