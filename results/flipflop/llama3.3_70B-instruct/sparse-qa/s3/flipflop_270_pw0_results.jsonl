Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\nGiven Input: w0r0w0r0w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1i1i0i1r0i0i0i0i0w0i1i1w0i1i1i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0i1w0i1w0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0w0i1i1i0i0i1i0w0i1i1i0i0r0i1w1w1w1i0i0i1i0w1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0w1r1i0r1i1r1i0i0i0i0i0w1i1i0r1i1i1i0r1w0i0i0i0r0i0w1i1r1r1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, and it is followed by no digit because it is the last character. However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually part of 'r1w0' and then there's 'i0w1' and then 'i1r1r1r' at the end. The actual last 'w' in the sequence before the end is in 'i1r1w0', but considering the sequence properly, the last 'w' before the end of the string is indeed in 'w1i1r1r1r', no, it's actually 'w0' in 'r1w0' which is followed by 'i0' and then 'w1' and then 'i1' and 'r1r1r'. \n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is in 'r1w0', and it's followed by 'i0', not a digit immediately after 'w', but considering the options and re-evaluating the string for the last 'w' before the end, we see 'w0' and then 'i0' and then 'w1' and it's followed by 'i1'. The confusion arises from the misinterpretation of the sequence. The correct sequence to consider for the rightmost 'w' is 'w0' which is followed by 'i0', and then there's 'w1' followed by 'i1'. \n\nGiven the correct understanding of the task, we should identify the last 'w' and the digit following it. The last 'w' before the end of the string is indeed 'w0' in 'r1w0i0w1i1r1r1r', and it's followed by 'i0', but the question asks for the digit after the 'w', and considering 'w0', the digit after 'w' in 'w0' is '0'. \n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
