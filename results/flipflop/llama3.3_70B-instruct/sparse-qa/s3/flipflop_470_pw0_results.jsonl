However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually not followed by any digit because it's at the end of the string. But since we need to choose from the given options and the task explicitly asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', we should note that in the provided string, the last 'w' is indeed followed by no character, but in the context of the question, it seems we are to consider the 'w's that are followed by characters. \n\nUpon reevaluation for clarity and adherence to the task: The actual last 'w' that is followed by a character in the string is \"w0\" at the end of the string \"w0i1i1i1w0i0i0i1i1i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0r\". Here, the 'w' is followed by \"0\".\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

However, upon closer inspection, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis since the task explicitly asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Given the string ends with '...i0i0i0r', it seems there was a misunderstanding in identifying the rightmost 'w' and its subsequent character.\n\nCorrecting the approach:\n- The actual rightmost 'w' in the string is indeed near the end, but the description provided initially might have led to confusion.\n- Upon re-examining the string, we notice the sequence '...i0w0i1i0w0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1w0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1w0i0i0r0i1i1r0i1w0i1i0w0i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i0r'.\n\nThe correct rightmost 'w' is followed by '0', as seen in '...w0i1i0w0...'. Thus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

Specifically, it's the last character before the last set of characters that include 'i' and 'r'.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the actual last 'w' is indeed part of \"w1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i0r1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1r\" but there's another 'w' after it which is \"w1\". The very last 'w' in the string is actually part of \"i0w1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0w1\" and the one immediately before the end is \"w0w0\".\n\nThe last 'w' is in \"w0w0\", and the character after the last 'w' in \"w0w0\" is indeed '0' because \"w0\" is the sequence, and '0' comes after 'w'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the input string, let's perform these steps:\n\nInput: w1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i0i0w1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0w1r1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0w1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r1w0i0r0w0i1w0i0i0i0i0i0w0r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0w1w1i0i0i1i1i0r1i0i1i1i0i1i0w0w0r0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0w1i0r1i1w1i1i1i1i0r1r1i0i0w1i1i0r1i0i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i1i0r1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0r1i0i0r1w0i0r0i1i1i1i0w0i1i1r0i1i1i0w0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i1i0i1i1i1r0i1r0i0i0i0i0i1i1r0i1w0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r0i0i0i0r0i0i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, and there is no character to its right. However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually part of a sequence where 'w' is followed by '0', but in this specific case, the string ends right after the last 'w'. Since there's no digit immediately after the last 'w' because the string ends there, we should consider the instruction and the provided options to determine the best course of action.\n\nGiven the options and the context, the task seems to be about identifying a pattern or making a choice based on the information provided. However, the instruction to find the digit after the rightmost 'w' and the string ending with 'w' without a following digit presents a scenario not directly addressed by the initial analysis.\n\nSince the string ends with 'w' and there's no digit after it, we cannot directly apply the initial steps as intended. The correct approach, given the constraints and the aim for an algorithmic solution, involves recognizing the limitation in the provided string and the question's framework.\n\nGiven this, the most appropriate response, adhering strictly to the format requested and considering the nature of the question, would be to select an option based on the pattern or the typical expectation in such scenarios. However, since the string ends with 'w' and does not provide a digit after it, the question's premise as it applies to the given string is not fully applicable.\n\nThus, considering the need to provide an answer within the specified format and acknowledging the unique situation presented by the string ending with 'w', the response should reflect the constraints of the question and the provided options.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

However, the task is to find the digit after the **rightmost** 'w'. In this case, there is no digit after the rightmost 'w' because it is the last character. But let's correct the approach based on the given options and the fact that we need to identify the digit following the last occurrence of 'w' in the string.\n\nUpon reevaluation, the last 'w' in the string is indeed followed by no digit because it's at the end, but the second to last 'w' is followed by a '1'. However, the question specifically asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w', and since there's no digit after the last 'w', the premise of the question seems to be flawed as it assumes there is a digit after the rightmost 'w' to choose from the given options.\n\nGiven the structure of the question and the provided options, it seems there might be an oversight in how the question is framed regarding the presence of a digit after the rightmost 'w'. If we were to correct the understanding based on standard interpretation, we'd look for the last 'w' and then the digit immediately following it. But since the last 'w' is at the end of the string, there's no digit to report based on the question's criteria.\n\nHowever, to adhere to the format requested and considering a potential misunderstanding in the question's framing, if we were to consider the last 'w' that has a digit following it (which would be the second to last 'w' in a practical search), the digit could be either 0 or 1 based on the string's content. But since the question specifically asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w' and there isn't one, the question's premise as it relates to the provided options seems flawed.\n\nGiven the above analysis and the need to select an option, the question's structure implies an expectation of finding a digit after the last 'w', which isn't present. Thus, based on the logic of finding the last 'w' and its following digit, but acknowledging the error in premise:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

However, looking closely, the last 'w' is not immediately followed by any digit because it's at the end of the string. But since we need to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', we should consider the 'w's that are not at the end. The second to last 'w' is also not followed by a digit immediately, as it is 'w0' at the end. However, considering the structure of the question, it seems we are looking for a 'w' that is followed by a digit. \n\nUpon closer inspection, one of the last occurrences of 'w' followed by a digit is 'w1' or 'w0'. Given the structure of the string and the question's requirements, the most relevant 'w' followed by a digit that is towards the right side of the string would be one of these instances. \n\nGiven the options and the need to select a digit immediately after a 'w', and considering the rightmost 'w's are 'w0' or 'w1', the answer could be either A or B depending on the exact 'w' considered. However, since the question asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w' and given the string ends with 'r0r', the last 'w' before this is 'w0', making the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually part of 'r0w0' which appears multiple times, but the very last occurrence of 'w' in the string is indeed 'w' followed by no digits, as it's the last character. The correct approach is to find the last 'w' that is not at the end of the string but is followed by a digit. \n\nUpon re-examining the string for the last 'w' that is followed by a digit, we notice the sequence 'r0w0'. The last 'w' that is followed by a digit is in this sequence, and the digit after it is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string, which is part of \"...i0i0i0i1r1i1i1r\".\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '1' since the string ends with \"...w1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1r\", but considering the instruction to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', we look for the last 'w' and the digit following it. The correct sequence to consider is the last occurrence of 'w' followed by a digit, which is actually \"...i1w0...\" or similar sequences. However, the task is to identify the digit immediately after the last 'w', which requires checking the string from right to left for the last 'w' and then looking at the next character.\n\nUpon re-examining the string from right to left for the last 'w' and the character immediately following it, we notice sequences like \"...w0...\", \"...w1...\", and we need to find the very last 'w' and the digit that comes after it. Given the complexity and the need for precision in identifying the exact sequence, let's simplify:\n\nThe last few characters of the string are \"...i0i1i0i0i0i0i1r1i1i1r\". Before this, there are several 'w's, but we are interested in the one that has a digit immediately after it and is the last in the sequence. \n\nGiven the structure of the problem and the need to identify the digit after the last 'w', and considering the provided options (A. 0, B. 1), the correct approach is to find the last 'w' that is directly followed by a digit. \n\nIn the provided string, the last 'w' that is directly followed by a digit is part of a sequence that ends with a digit. The correct sequence to look for is the last occurrence of 'w' that is immediately followed by either '0' or '1'. \n\nUpon careful examination, we find that the last 'w' is followed by '0' in the sequence \"...w0...\". This indicates that the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
