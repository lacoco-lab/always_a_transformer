However, the task asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w'. Given the string ends with \"...i0i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r\", the last 'w' is actually before the last sequence of characters. The correct approach is to find the last 'w' and then look at the character immediately following it.\n\nUpon re-examining the string for the rightmost 'w' and the character immediately after it, we notice the string \"...w0i0r0i0w1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r\". The rightmost 'w' is followed by a '1', but considering the entire string, the actual last 'w' is before \"...i1i0i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r\", which means we are looking for the 'w' that is immediately followed by a digit.\n\nGiven the correct identification of the rightmost 'w' and its following character, the task becomes straightforward. The last 'w' in the sequence \"...w1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r\" is actually before the \"...i1i0i1i0i1r1...\". The correct 'w' to look at is the one right before the last sequence of characters that does not include another 'w'. \n\nThe correct 'w' to consider is the last one before the string ends with no more 'w's, which upon careful examination, is \"...w1i1i1i0...\". Thus, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
