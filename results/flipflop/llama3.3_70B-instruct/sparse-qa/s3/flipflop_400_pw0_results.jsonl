Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n3. Determine if this character is '0' or '1' to choose between options A and B.\n\nGiven the input string:\nw1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1w1r1i1i0i1i1i1w0i1i0i0i1i0i1w0i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i1r0i0w0i0i0r0r0i1i1i1w1i0i0i1i1r1i0i0i1w1w1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r0i1i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0r0i0i0i0i0w1i0i0i0w1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1w1r1w0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i0r0r0i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1r1i0r\n\nStarting from the end of the string and moving left, we find the first 'w' which is the rightmost 'w'. The string ends with \"...i0r\", and moving left, we find 'w's in the following positions from right to left: \n- \"...w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1r1i0r\" (this 'w' is followed by '1')\n- \"...w0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i0r0r0i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1r1i0r\" (this 'w' is followed by '0')\n- \"...w1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1w1r1w0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i0r0r0i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1r1i0r\" (this 'w' is followed by '1')\n- \"...w1i0i0i0w1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1w1r1w0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i0r0r0i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i1r1i0r\" (this 'w' is followed by '1')\n\nThe very last 'w' in the string is \"...w1i0i0i0w1...\", and it is followed by '1'. However, we need to consider the 'w' that is rightmost and has a character after it. The last 'w' that has a character after it and is not part of \"w1\" at the end is actually part of \"...w0i1...\". But looking closely at the end of the string, the actual last 'w' with a digit after it is part of \"...w0i1...\". \n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
