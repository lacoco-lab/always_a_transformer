Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the input string: w0i0i0r0i1i1i1i0w0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0r0i0i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1w0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0r0r0w1i0i0r1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1w1i1i1i0i1r1w1i0i0w1i1i0i1w1i0w1r1w0i0i0i0r0i0w0w0i0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r\n\nLet's start from the end of the string and find the first 'w' we encounter, which will be the rightmost 'w'.\n\nStarting from the end: ...i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r - there's no 'w' here. Continuing backwards: ...w0w0i0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0r - here we find a 'w', but let's ensure it's the rightmost by checking if there are any 'w's further to the right, which there aren't since we started from the end.\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is in \"...w0w0...\". The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
