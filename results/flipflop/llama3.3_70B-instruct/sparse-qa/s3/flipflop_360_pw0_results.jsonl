The actual last 'w' that has a character after it is part of \"i1w0\" or similar patterns, but the very last 'w's are standalone or part of patterns where 'w' is the last character before the end of the string or before another 'w'. \n\nGiven the string ends with \"...i1w0i0r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0r\", the rightmost 'w' that has a digit after it is indeed the one in \"...i1w0...\".

Starting from the end of the string and moving left, we find 'w' in \"...i1i1i0r1i1i1i0r1i1i1r\". The 'w' before this 'r' sequence is the rightmost 'w'.\n\nNow, looking at the character immediately to the right of this 'w', we see it is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1', which corresponds to option B.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
