Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the input string, let's perform these steps:\n\nInput: w1i0r1i0w1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0w1i1i1i1i0i0i1w1i0i1i1i0w1i1i0i1i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r1w0i0r0i1i1i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r1i1i1w0i0w0r0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1w0i0i1i1r0r0i1i1r0i0i0w0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0r0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0i0r0i1i0w1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1r1i1i0i1i0w1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0w1w1w1i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i1r1i1i0w1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w1r\". Therefore, there is no character to the right of the rightmost 'w'. However, since the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w' and given the structure of the question, it seems we are to consider the 'w' that is not at the very end if we're looking for a digit immediately after a 'w'. \n\nUpon reevaluation for clarity and following the instruction precisely as given, the actual task is to identify the digit immediately following the rightmost 'w' that is not at the end of the string, which would be the last 'w' before the final characters. However, given the phrasing, if we strictly interpret \"rightmost 'w'\" as the very last 'w' in the sequence, there's no digit after it since it's followed by '1r' and then the string ends. \n\nGiven this strict interpretation might lead to confusion without a digit immediately after the last 'w', let's correct the approach based on the likely intent: If we look at the sequence and the question's framing, it seems the intent might be to find the last 'w' that has a digit immediately after it, which would be part of the sequence's pattern. The last sequence before the end is \"w1r\", indicating the digit after a 'w' in the pattern provided is '1'. \n\nThus, based on the pattern and the question's options provided, the correct answer, following the clarification and the pattern observed, would be:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
