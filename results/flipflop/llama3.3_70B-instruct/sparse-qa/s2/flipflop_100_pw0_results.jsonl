The question asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Since the sequence is \"...w1w1w1r\", the rightmost 'w' is followed by no digit directly after it because it's the last 'w' before the 'r'. However, considering the sequence correctly, the last 'w' before 'r' is part of \"w1\" where '1' is the digit after a 'w', but not directly after the very last 'w' since it's followed by another 'w'. \n\nGiven the structure of the question, it seems we should consider the last occurrence of 'w' followed by a digit, which would be in \"w1\" before the last set of 'w's. Thus, the digit after the 'w' in the last \"w1\" sequence before the final 'w's is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
