Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n3. Determine if this character is '0' or '1' to choose between options A and B.\n\nGiven the \"Input\" string:\nw1i0i1i0i1i1w1i1i0i0i0w1i0i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i0w0i1i1i1i1r0i0i1w0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1r0i0i1i0r0i0i1i1i0r0r0w1r1i1i1w0i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i0w1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r\n\nLet's perform the steps:\n\n1. The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string: ...i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is not present in the last position but let's re-evaluate the string to find the actual rightmost 'w'. Upon re-examining, we see the string ends with \"...i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r\", and the last 'w' before this ending is actually \"w1\" which is followed by \"r1i1i1w0\" and then more characters until the end. The very last 'w' is in \"w0\" and then \"w1\" appears before the last set of characters. The actual last 'w' is in the sequence \"w1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r\" which is not the last 'w'. The correct last 'w' is indeed in \"w0\" or \"w1\" before the last sequence of characters. \n\nUpon a detailed review, the last 'w' is in \"w1\" which is followed by \"r1i1i1w0\", and the 'w' in \"w0\" is the last 'w' in the string. \n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the last 'w' (which is in \"w0\") is '0' since \"w0\" is followed by \"i1r0i0i0i1i1i0i0w1...\". However, the correct sequence to look at is the one where \"w0\" is the last 'w', and it is followed by \"i1r0...\". \n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
