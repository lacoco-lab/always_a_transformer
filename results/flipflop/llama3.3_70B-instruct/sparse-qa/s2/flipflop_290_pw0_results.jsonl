Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given string:\n\nInput: w0i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i0r0i0i0i0i0r0i0r0i0w0i1i1r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i0r0i0i0i1i0r0i0i0w0i1i0r0r0w1r1i0i1i1i0w0w0r0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r0w0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1r0r0r0i1r0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i0i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0w1r1i1i1i0i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, but since there's no character after it, we look at the second rightmost 'w'. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Upon closer inspection, we see that the actual rightmost 'w' is indeed followed by a character.\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in \"...i0i1w0i0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r0i0i0i1i0i0r\". No, it's not. The rightmost 'w' is actually in \"...i1w0i0i0i0i1i1r0...\". No, the string ends with \"...i0i1w...\". \n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is indeed at the end of the string \"...i0i1w\". There is no digit after this 'w' because it's the last character in the string. However, the prompt asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', implying we should consider the 'w' that has a character after it if the very last 'w' does not. \n\nGiven the string structure and the question's phrasing, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the presence of a digit immediately after the last 'w'. Since the last 'w' is at the end of the string, we should consider the second-to-last 'w' for the purpose of this task, which is \"...w1r1i1i1i0i0i1w0...\". No, the correct sequence to look at is the last 'w' that has a digit after it, which would be the second-to-last 'w' if we were not considering the very last character. However, the correct approach is to find the last 'w' that is not at the end of the string.\n\nUpon reevaluation: The last 'w' that is not the very last character in the string and has a digit after it is actually in the sequence \"...i1w1...\". Here, the 'w' is followed by '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

However, upon re-examining the string for accuracy, the actual last 'w' is indeed within \"...i0w1r1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0w1...\". The correct sequence to look at is the last occurrence of 'w' which is in \"...w1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0r1w0...\".
