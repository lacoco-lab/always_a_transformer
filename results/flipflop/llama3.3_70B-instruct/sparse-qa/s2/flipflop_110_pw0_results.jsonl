However, the task specifically asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', and since 'r' is not a digit, we should directly look at the provided options and the context of the question. The question seems to imply looking for a digit immediately following a 'w' in a sequence where digits are expected to follow 'w'. Given the structure of the string and the options provided, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the direct sequence expected.\n\nGiven the sequence and focusing strictly on the task: after the last 'w' (which is 'w0'), the next character is indeed 'r', not a digit. However, considering the context and the options provided (A. 0, B. 1), and re-evaluating the string for a pattern or an implication of a digit following 'w' in a significant position, the question's framing suggests looking for a digit in a context where 'w' is followed by a digit in the pattern of the string. \n\nThe last 'w' is followed by '0', which is a digit, directly answering the question without needing further sequence analysis. Thus, the correct answer, given the direct question and options, is:\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
