However, looking closely, the last 'w' is not immediately followed by any digit because it's at the end. But since we need to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', we should consider the 'w's that are not at the end. The second to last 'w' is also not followed by a digit immediately after it in a way that we can determine the answer from the given options directly without confusion. \n\nHowever, upon closer inspection and following the instructions precisely to find the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is not at the end of the string, we see that the second to last 'w' is followed by a '1'. This 'w' is part of 'w1' which appears before the last 'w's and other characters at the end of the string.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' (considering the 'w' that is not at the very end and has a digit immediately after it) is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
