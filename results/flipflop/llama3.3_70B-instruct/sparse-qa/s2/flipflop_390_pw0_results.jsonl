However, upon closer inspection of the provided string and following the correct method:\n\nThe actual rightmost 'w' is indeed at the very end of the string \"...i1r0i1i1r\" is incorrect as it doesn't account for the 'w's properly. The correct approach is to find the last occurrence of 'w' and then look at the next character. \n\nUpon re-examining the string correctly:\nThe last 'w' is actually in the sequence that ends the string, but given the string's complexity and the need for precision, let's accurately identify the last 'w' and the character following it.\n\nGiven the correct approach and re-evaluating the string for the rightmost 'w' and the digit immediately after it, the focus should be on the last part of the string where 'w' appears and then identifying the next character.\n\nThe correct sequence to look for the rightmost 'w' and the character after it involves carefully scanning the string from right to left for the 'w' character and then identifying the digit that follows it. \n\nGiven the string and the task, the rightmost 'w' and the digit after it should be identified with precision. \n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. The last 'w' in the string is followed by no digit because it is the last character, but the second to last 'w' is also not followed by a digit immediately in some cases. We need to find the last 'w' that is followed by a character and then determine if that character is a digit.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the string ends with \"...i1i0r\", indicating the last 'w' is not immediately followed by a digit but rather is part of \"...i0w0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1w1r1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0w1i0i1i0i0r1i0i1i1i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i0i0i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1r1r1i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0r\". The actual last 'w' that has a character after it is \"...w1r...\". \n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that has a following character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
