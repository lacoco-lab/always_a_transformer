Let's correct the approach by finding the last 'w' and then looking at the character immediately after it.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, we notice the last occurrence of 'w' is indeed not at the very end but rather before some characters.

However, upon closer inspection, we see that there are multiple 'w's, and the very last 'w' is indeed followed by a '0', but we should confirm there are no 'w's after the last one mentioned that could potentially change the outcome. Given the string ends with \"...i0i1i0r0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1w0i1i1i1w0r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0r\", the last 'w' is indeed 'w0', confirming our initial observation.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
