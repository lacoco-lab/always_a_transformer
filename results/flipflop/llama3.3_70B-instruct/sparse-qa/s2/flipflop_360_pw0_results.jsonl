However, looking closely, the last 'w' is not immediately followed by any digit because it's at the end of the string. But since we need to choose from the given options and the task explicitly asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', we must consider the context of the question and the provided options.\n\nGiven the structure of the string, 'w' is often followed by either '0' or '1'. Since the question asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w' and provides options A (0) or B (1), and considering the pattern of the string where 'w' is frequently followed by '0' or '1', but the last 'w' does not have a following digit, the question seems to be testing the understanding of the string's pattern rather than the literal presence of a digit after the last 'w'.\n\nHowever, strictly following the instruction without assuming patterns or considering the absence of a digit after the last 'w', the correct approach is to identify the last 'w' and look for the digit immediately after it. Since there's no digit after the last 'w' because it's the end of the string, and given the nature of the question which seems to expect an analysis based on the provided options, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in how the question is framed regarding the presence of a digit after the last 'w'.\n\nGiven the options and the expectation to choose one, but acknowledging the literal interpretation that there is no digit after the last 'w', the task as described does not align with the provided string's structure for a direct answer based on the presence of a digit immediately after the last 'w'. \n\nBut to adhere to the format requested and considering the nature of the task which might imply looking for a pattern or an assumption not directly stated, and given that 'w' is often followed by either '0' or '1' in the string but not after the very last 'w', the question's premise seems flawed for a definitive answer based on the string provided.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
