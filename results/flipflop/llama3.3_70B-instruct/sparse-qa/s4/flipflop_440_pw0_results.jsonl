However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually followed by no digit because it's at the end of a sequence 'w1w1w1' and then 'i1w1i0i1i1w1...'. The very last 'w' in the string is not followed by any digit since it's part of 'w1' and the last character in the string is 'r', indicating the last 'w' is in 'w1' and the '1' is the digit after the second to last 'w', but for the very last 'w', there's no digit after it as it ends the sequence before the last 'r'. \n\nHowever, upon re-examining the task, it seems the focus is on finding the digit immediately after the last occurrence of 'w' in the string. Given the string ends with '...i1i1r', and tracing back, the last 'w' before this ending is in '...w1w1w1i1...'. Thus, the digit immediately after the last 'w' in the sequence 'w1w1w1' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually part of 'w1' or 'w0' patterns throughout the string, but the very last character in the string is 'r', indicating the last 'w' is indeed followed by characters in its occurrences before the last 'r'. The actual last 'w' in a 'w' followed by a digit pattern is 'w0' before the last 'r0r0i0i1i0r'. \n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually part of a sequence of 'w's at the end, and before these 'w's, there's a sequence of characters. The actual last 'w' that is not followed by another 'w' but could be considered as part of the sequence where 'w' is not the last character in the string is not present as the string ends with 'w's. \n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the string actually ends with \"...i1i1r\", indicating the last 'w' before this sequence is the one we should look at. The sequence before the last set of 'w's and other characters is \"...i1i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1w1...\". Here, we see a 'w' followed by a '1'. \n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is not part of a 'w' sequence at the very end but is part of the string where 'w' is followed by other characters is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the input string, let's perform these steps:\n\nInput: w0i0i0r0i1i1w0w0w0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1r0i0i1i1i1i0w0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0r0i0i0w1i0r1i1i0i1r1w1i0r1w1i0r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0w1i0r1i1w0i1r0i0i1r0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0w1i1i1r1i1i1i0r1w1i0i1i0i1i1i1r1w1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0w1i1r1i0i1w0i0r0r0i0i0i1i1i0i1r0r0r0i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0w0i0i0i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i1i1i1w0i1i0i0i0r0i0i1i1i0i1r0i0r0i1i0w0r0i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1r0w0i0i0i1w0w0i0i0i1i0i0i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, and it is followed by no character because it is the last character. However, looking closely, the last 'w' is indeed at the end, but there's another 'w' before the last sequence of characters that could potentially have a digit after it. Let's re-evaluate the string to ensure we find the rightmost 'w' that has a character after it.\n\nUpon re-evaluation, the actual rightmost 'w' that has a character after it is not the very last character but one of the 'w's before the end of the string. The string ends with \"...i0i1r\", indicating the last 'w' does not have a digit immediately after it because it's the last character. However, looking at the sequence before the last few characters, we find a 'w' that is followed by a digit.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precision, let's simplify the approach by directly examining the end of the string for the last 'w' that is not the final character:\n\n\"...i0i0i1w0w0i0i0i1i0i0i1r\"\n\nHere, the 'w' in question is followed by a '0'. \n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Given the string ends with '...i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i1r', the last 'w' is actually before this sequence. The correct approach is to find the last 'w' and then look at the character immediately following it.\n\nUpon re-examining the string for the last occurrence of 'w' and the character immediately after it, we notice the string \"...w0i1w0i1w0w0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0r0r0...\" contains the last 'w's. The very last 'w' in the string is followed by a '0'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
