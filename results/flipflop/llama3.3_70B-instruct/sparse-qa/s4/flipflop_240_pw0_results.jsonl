However, given the instruction, we should consider the last 'w' in the string for this task. Since there's no character after the last 'w', we should re-evaluate our approach based on the provided options and the context of the question.\n\nGiven the context and the options provided (A. 0, B. 1), and re-evaluating the string, if we consider the last 'w' that has a character after it, we find:\n\n- ...i0i1i0r1w1...\n- ...i1i0i1w1...\n- ...i1i1i0i1w1...\n\nIn all cases where 'w' is followed by a character, the character is '1'.
