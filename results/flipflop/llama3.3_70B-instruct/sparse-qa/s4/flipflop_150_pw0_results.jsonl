The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

Thus, the rightmost 'w' is in \"...i0i1i0i1w...\". The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0', which corresponds to option A.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
