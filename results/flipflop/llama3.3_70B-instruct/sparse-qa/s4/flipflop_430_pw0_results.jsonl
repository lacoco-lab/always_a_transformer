Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given string:\n\nInput: w1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r1w0i1r0i0i1i0w0r0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i0r0i1i0i1i0r0i0i1i1w1i0r1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1r1i0i1i0i0i0r1i1i0r1r1r1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i1w1i0i1i0i0r1i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1w0w0i0r0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0i0r0i0i1i1i1w0r0i1r0i0w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1w1w1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i0r1i1w0w0i1i1w0r0r0i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i0w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i1i1i1i0w1i1i0i1r1i0w1i0i1r1i0w1i0i0i0i0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, and there are multiple 'w's at the end. The last 'w' is followed by no digit because it is the last character in the string. However, looking at the sequence of 'w's at the end: \"...i0w1w1i0r1i1i0i0i1i0i1r1i0r1i1w0w0i1i1w0r0r0i0i1r0i1i0i0i0i0w1i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r1i0i1i1i1i0w1i1i0i1r1i0w1i0i1r1i0w1i0i0i0i0r\", we see that the second to last 'w' (which is part of \"w0\" before the last 'w' in \"w1\") is followed by a '0'. But since the question asks for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w', and there are 'w's followed by '1' and '0' before the last 'w', the actual last 'w' does not have a digit after it because it's at the end of the string. \n\nHowever, considering the spirit of the question seems to be about finding the digit immediately after a 'w' in the sequence provided, and given the structure of the question, it seems there might be an oversight in how the question is framed regarding the very last character. If we consider the intent to be about the last 'w' that has a character following it, then we look at the sequence before the last 'w' which is \"w1\" indicating a '1' follows a 'w'. But strictly speaking, the last 'w' does not have a digit after it as it's the last character.\n\nGiven the options and the structure of the question, it seems the intent might be to identify the pattern or the digit following the 'w' in the sequence provided, not necessarily the very last character if it doesn't have a following digit. However, following the instructions to the letter as requested:\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

However, upon closer inspection, we see that there are several 'w's, and the actual rightmost 'w' that has a character after it is not at the end but rather within the string. Let's correctly identify it:\n\nUpon re-examining the string, we notice the last 'w' that is not at the end of the string is actually \"i1w0r0\". Here, the 'w' is followed by a '0'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that has a character following it is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

However, looking closely, the last 'w' is indeed at the end, but there's another 'w' before it which is followed by a '1'. The task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Since the very last character is 'w' and there's no digit after it, we should consider the 'w' that has a digit immediately after it, which is 'w1' at the end of the string. However, this interpretation seems to misunderstand the instruction to find the digit after the \"rightmost\" 'w', which indeed refers to the last 'w' in the string. Given the string ends with 'w', and there's no digit after the last 'w', the correct approach is to identify the last 'w' and acknowledge there's no digit following it, but since the task demands a choice between A (0) and B (1) and given the nature of the question, it seems we are to consider the 'w' that has a digit immediately after it in the context of the entire string for a meaningful answer. The confusion arises from the phrasing of the task. \n\nGiven the last 'w' does not have a digit after it, but looking at the string for a 'w' followed by a digit to make a choice based on the provided options, we see 'w1' as a pattern that fits the criteria of having a digit after 'w', but this does not directly answer the question as phrased because the very last 'w' does not have a following digit. The task's aim seems to be about finding a digit after a 'w', and in the context of making a choice based on the provided string and options, one might argue the relevant 'w' to consider for a digit is not the last one due to the absence of a digit after it.\n\nHowever, strictly following the instruction to find the digit after the \"rightmost\" 'w' and given the rightmost 'w' has no digit after it, the task as stated does not directly apply because there's no digit to choose. But to adhere to the format and provide an answer based on the options given and the context that we're looking for a digit after a 'w' in a general sense within the string, and considering the pattern of 'w' followed by a digit in the string, one might look at the last occurrence of 'w' that has a digit after it for a basis of choice, which would be 'w1', suggesting a '1' as the digit after a 'w' in the string's context. Yet, this explanation acknowledges the confusion and the direct answer to the question as posed, which is about the last 'w', does not fit the expected response format due to the absence of a digit after the last 'w'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
