The 'w' in question is the one right before \"...i0i1i0i1i0i1w0...\". So, the 'w' we are looking at is the second to last 'w' in \"...w0i0i1i0i1i0i1w0...\". However, we need to consider the very last 'w's in the sequence \"...w0w0...\". \n\nThus, the rightmost 'w' is actually in the sequence \"...w0w0...\", and the character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
