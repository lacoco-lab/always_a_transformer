Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the input string: w1i0i1i1i0i1r1i0w1i1i1i1i1r1r1i0i1w1i1r1i1i1i1i1r1w1i0i0i0i1r1i0w0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1r0i0r0i1i1i0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0r0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1w1w1i0w1i0i1r1i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i0i0r1i0w0i0i0i1r\n\nLet's start from the end of the string and find the first 'w', which will be the rightmost 'w'. \n\nStarting from the end: ...i0w0i0i0i1r... there's a 'w', but let's continue to ensure it's the rightmost. Further to the right, there are no more 'w's until ...w1w1i0w1i0... Here, there are multiple 'w's, and the rightmost 'w' is the last one in this sequence, which is followed by '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
