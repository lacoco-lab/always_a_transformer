The rightmost 'w' is found at the very end of the string.\n2. The character immediately to the right of the last 'w' does not exist since 'w' is the last character, but looking at the string, the last 'w' is followed by no digit, it is the last character. However, my analysis was incorrect in assuming we look for a 'w' followed by a digit within the string's bounds. The task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Since the rightmost 'w' is at the end, there's no digit after it to consider from the given options. The correct approach should involve looking for the last occurrence of 'w' that is not at the end of the string or considering the context of the question more accurately.\n\nGiven the misunderstanding in the analysis, let's correct the approach:\n\nUpon re-evaluation, considering the last 'w' that is not at the end of the string and is followed by a character, we see the string ends with \"...i0i0i0i0i1r1i0i0i0i0i0r1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1r1i0i0r\". The last 'w' before this ending sequence is \"w1\" which is followed by \"i1\". However, the task is about the digit after the 'w', not the letter. The correct sequence to look at should end with a 'w' followed by a digit. \n\nThe correct sequence to consider for the last 'w' followed by a digit is indeed \"w1\" since it directly answers the question about the digit after 'w'. \n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is directly followed by a digit in the sequence provided is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
