However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually not followed by any digit since it's at the very end. But if we look at the second to last 'w', it's also not followed by a digit immediately in a way that we can determine the answer directly from the given options without considering the context of the question which asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. \n\nGiven the structure of the question, it seems we are to consider the 'w' that has a digit immediately after it and is the rightmost among such 'w's. Upon reviewing the string again for the purpose of this task and the provided options, the actual task is to identify the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit and choose the correct option based on that.\n\nUpon reevaluation for clarity and adherence to the task:\n- The string ends with \"...i0i0i0i0r0i1i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0r\", which does not directly help since we're looking for a 'w' followed by a digit.\n- The last 'w' followed by a digit in the string is actually \"w1\" which appears multiple times, but we're interested in the last occurrence of 'w' followed by a digit.\n\nGiven the last part of the string \"...i1i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0r\", we see that before this part, there's \"...w0i0r0i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i0w1i1i1i0i0i0r1i1w0i0r0w0i1i1i1i1i1i0r0i1r0i1i1i0i1w1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1r1i0i0r1i0i1w1i0i0i0i1i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0w1i0r1i0r1i0i0w1r1i1r1i1i1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i0r1i1i0r1w1i0i0i1i0r1r1r1i1i0i0i1i1i0r1i0i1i0i1w1i1i1i0r1w1i0i0w1r1i1i0w0i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0r0i1i0r0i0i1i0i0i0i1i0r\", the last 'w' that is followed by a digit is \"w1\".\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

However, looking closely, the last 'w' is not immediately followed by any digit because it's at the end. But since we need to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', we should consider the 'w's that are not at the end. \n\nUpon closer inspection, the second to last 'w' is also not followed by a digit immediately after it in a way that we can determine the answer directly without considering the context of the question which asks for the digit after the 'w'. However, considering the structure of the string and the question's requirements, we should look for a 'w' that is followed by a digit.\n\nGiven the structure of the input and the fact that 'w' is often followed by '1' or '0' in the given string, we can observe the pattern but must identify the rightmost 'w' that has a digit immediately after it. \n\nIn the string, one of the last occurrences of 'w' followed by a digit is \"...i0w1i0...\", \"...w1r1...\", or simply \"...w1...\". Given these patterns, the digit immediately after 'w' in these cases is '1'. \n\nTherefore, based on the pattern observed and the requirement to find the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit, the answer would be:\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
