However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. The last 'w' in the string is followed by no digit because it is at the end of the string. The second to last 'w' is also not followed by a digit immediately, as it is 'w1' but there are other 'w's after which we should check. \n\nUpon closer inspection, the actual last 'w' that has a digit immediately after it is 'w1' near the end. Thus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that has a following digit is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
