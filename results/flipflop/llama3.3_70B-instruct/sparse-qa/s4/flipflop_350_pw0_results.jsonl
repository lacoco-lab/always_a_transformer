However, to ensure accuracy, let's confirm the position of the last few 'w's and the characters following them:\n\n- ...i1i0r0r0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0w1i0i1r1i1r1r1w0r0w1i0i1r1i1i0r1i0i0r1r1i1i1w0i0i1i1i0r0i0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0r\n\nThe sequence shows 'w1', 'w0', 'w1', 'w0' towards the end. The character after each 'w' is '1', '0', '1', '0' respectively. The very last 'w' does not have a following digit as it's at the end of the string, but the second to last 'w' (which is 'w0') is followed by a '0'. However, my initial approach to directly identify the digit after the rightmost 'w' was incorrect because I should have directly looked for the last 'w' that has a character after it and identified that character.\n\nGiven the correct approach and re-evaluating the end of the string: ...i1i0r0r0i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i1i0w1i0i1r1i1r1r1w0r0w1i0i1r1i1i0r1i0i0r1r1i1i1w0i0i1i1i0r0i0r0r0i1i0r0i1i0r, the last 'w' that has a digit after it is 'w0', and the digit after it is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
