Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n3.

The string ends with \"...i0i0i1i0r0i1i0i0i1r0i1r0i0r0i1r\", and before this part, there's \"...i1i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i0w0...\". So, the 'w' we are looking for is this \"...i0w0...\". \n\nThe character immediately after 'w0' is 'i', but we need to find the digit after 'w', so we continue looking. The next digit after 'w0' is '1'.\n\nHowever, my analysis initially missed the correct 'w' to consider due to the complexity of the string. Let's correct that and follow the proper steps again, focusing on finding the rightmost 'w' and then identifying the digit immediately after it.\n\nUpon re-examining the string closely, the actual rightmost 'w' is indeed part of \"...i0w0...\", and immediately after 'w0', the next character is 'i', not a digit. The task, however, asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Given the structure of the string, after 'w0', the next digit we encounter is '1', as in \"...w0i1...\".\n\nThus, the correct digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
