However, looking closely, the last 'w' is indeed followed by no digit because it's the last character in the sequence given. But since we need to find the digit after the rightmost 'w' and there isn't one because the string ends with 'w', we should consider the instruction as looking for the digit immediately following the last 'w' in the sequence provided.\n\nGiven the structure of the task, it seems we are to identify the digit following the last occurrence of 'w' in the string. Since the string ends with 'w' and there's no digit after it, the task as described doesn't fit the provided string's structure because there's no digit after the last 'w'. However, if we consider the intent might be to find the last 'w' that has a digit after it, we'd look for the second to last 'w' and see what's after it.\n\nUpon reevaluation for clarity and adherence to the task:\n- The last 'w' is at the end, so there's no digit after it.\n- The task seems to be about finding a digit after a 'w', implying we should look for a 'w' that is not at the end.\n\nGiven this, if we look at the second to last 'w' (since the last 'w' doesn't have a digit after it), we find 'w1' before the last 'w0i0i0i1i1r0i0i0r'. The digit after this 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
