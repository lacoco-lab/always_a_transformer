Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the string: w0i0i0i0i1r0w0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1w0i1r0i1i0i1w0i0i0i1i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1w1i0i0i0i0i0w1w1i1r1i1i1r\n\nLet's find the rightmost 'w':\n\n- Starting from the end of the string and moving left, the first 'w' we encounter is the rightmost 'w'.\n- The string ends with \"...i1r1i1i1r\", so we move left until we find a 'w'.\n- Moving left, we find \"...w1w1...\" which means the rightmost 'w' is the second 'w' in \"...w1w1...\".\n\nNow, we look at the character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w':\n\n- The rightmost 'w' is followed by '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
