However, following the instructions to the letter as requested:\n\nSince there's no digit immediately after the last 'w' because the string ends there, and given the nature of the options which imply a choice based on the presence of a digit, the task as described does not directly apply to the situation where 'w' is the last character.

However, the task is to find the digit after the rightmost 'w'. Given the string ends with \"...i0r1i0r\", the last 'w' is actually followed by a '1' because the sequence \"...w1i0i1i0i1i0r\" indicates the 'w' in question is 'w1', and '1' is indeed the digit immediately after 'w'.\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

Here, the 'w' is followed by '0'.\n\nGiven the structure of the question, it seems we are looking for the last 'w' that is directly followed by a digit, which would be '0' based on the sequence \"...w0...\".\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
