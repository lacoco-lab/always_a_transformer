However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually not followed by any digit because it's at the end of the string. But since we need to choose from the given options and the task explicitly asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', we must consider the context of the question carefully.\n\nGiven the structure of the task, it seems we are to assume there's always a digit after the 'w' in question or interpret the question in a way that fits the provided options. However, strictly following the provided string, there's no digit after the last 'w'. \n\nBut, re-evaluating the string and the question's intent, and considering we must choose between A (0) and B (1), and noting the pattern of the string, the question might be seen as flawed because the rightmost 'w' does not have a digit following it. \n\nHowever, if we were to look at the second to the last 'w' which is followed by a digit, we see it's followed by '0'. Given the constraints of the question and the available choices, and considering a potential misunderstanding in the question's framing regarding the presence of a digit after the last 'w', the closest adherence to the instructions and choosing from the provided options based on the pattern observed would suggest:\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
