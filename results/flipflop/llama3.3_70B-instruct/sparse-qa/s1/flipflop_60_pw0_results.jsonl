Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the string: w0i0i1i0i0i0i1r0i1i0i1i0i0w0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1r\n\nFirst, we locate the rightmost 'w'. The string contains two 'w's. The rightmost 'w' is the second one: ...0i0w0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i0i0i0i1r\n\nThe character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<answer>A</answer>"}
