Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2.

However, looking at the string, the last 'w' is actually followed by no digit because it's at the end. But if we look closely, there are multiple 'w's at the end, and the actual last character is 'r', not 'w'. The correct approach is to find the last 'w' that is not at the end of the string but is followed by a character.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, we notice that the last 'w' that is followed by a character is actually \"w0\" at the end of the string \"i0w0\". However, considering the entire string and the instruction to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', we should correctly identify the last 'w' that has a digit immediately after it.\n\nThe correct sequence to look for is the last occurrence of 'w' that is immediately followed by a digit. Given the complexity and the need for precision in identifying the rightmost 'w' followed by a digit, let's simplify:\n\nThe string ends with \"...i1i1i1r0i0i1r0i1r0i0w0i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i0i1i1i1i0r\", and the last 'w' in this context that is followed by a digit is indeed \"w0\".\n\nThus, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a digit is \"0\".\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

However, in this case, the last 'w' is indeed the rightmost character in a sequence of 'w's at the end. The string ends with \"...i1w0r0i0w0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r\", so the last 'w' before the end of the string that is not part of a 'w' sequence at the very end is actually \"...i0w0r0i0w0...\". But looking closely, the very last 'w' in the string is part of \"...w0r0i0w0...\", and there's another 'w' after it, making \"...i0w0...\" the last 'w' before a non-'w' character sequence that doesn't immediately end the string.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the actual last 'w' that is immediately followed by a digit (which is what we are looking for) is indeed part of the sequence \"...w0...\". This sequence appears multiple times, but the key is finding the last occurrence where 'w' is directly followed by a digit.\n\nGiven the string structure and focusing on the last part \"...i1w0r0i0w0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r\", the 'w' that is directly followed by a digit (in this case, '0') is the one we are interested in. \n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character that is directly followed by a digit is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
