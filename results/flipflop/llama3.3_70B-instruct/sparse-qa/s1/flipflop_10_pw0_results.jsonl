The rightmost 'w' is the first 'w' encountered when scanning from right to left, which is 'w' in 'rw'.\n\nStep 2: The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' in 'rw' is 'r', but since we are looking for a digit and there's no digit immediately after 'w' in this case, we need to reconsider our approach based on the given options and the string provided.\n\nUpon reevaluation:\n- The rightmost 'w' is indeed in the sequence 'rw'.\n- However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', and in the sequence 'rw', there's no digit immediately after 'w'. Given the options and the context, it seems the task implies looking for a digit in relation to the 'w' characters' positions in a broader sense.\n\nConsidering the entire string and the positions of 'w' and digits:\n- The string is w0i0i1r0r.\n- The rightmost 'w' is part of 'rw', and there's no digit immediately after this 'w'.\n- However, looking at the overall string, the digits are 0, 0, 1, 0, and they relate to the positions of 'w', 'i', 'r' in various sequences.\n\nGiven the options A (0) and B (1), and considering the need to select a digit that could be associated with the position after a 'w' in some interpretative sense, we must directly address the question's specific phrasing and options provided.\n\nThe question asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w', but given the structure of the string (w0i0i1r0r), and the fact that 'w' is followed by '0' in its first occurrence, and considering the rightmost 'w' does not directly precede a digit in the 'rw' sequence, the direct answer based on the provided options and the implication of the question seems to be focused on the association of 'w' with digits in the string.\n\nThus, considering the direct interpretation might not fully align with the expected analysis due to the 'rw' sequence at the end, the task's framing suggests looking for a digit associated with 'w' in a manner that fits the given choices, which could imply considering the first 'w' and its associated digit or the overall pattern of digits and letters.\n\nHowever, strictly following the instruction for the format of the answer without further elaboration on the interpretative steps:\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

Since 'w' is directly followed by 'r' and not a digit, and considering the pattern of the string where 'w' and 'r' are followed by digits in other instances, the question's framing suggests looking for a digit associated with 'w' or 'r' in the pattern. However, strictly following the given instructions without assuming information not provided:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is followed by 'r', and then '0'. But since the question specifically asks for the digit after the 'w' and given the direct sequence is 'wr', not a digit, the question's premise as understood leads to confusion because 'w' is not directly followed by a digit in the provided sequence. \n\nGiven this, and adhering strictly to the format requested for the answer without further elaboration on the confusion in the question's premise:\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
