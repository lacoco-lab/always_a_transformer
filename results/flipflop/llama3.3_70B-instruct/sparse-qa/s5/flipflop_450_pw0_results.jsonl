Let's correct the approach by finding the last 'w' that is followed by a character:\n\nUpon re-examining, the actual last 'w' that has a character after it is \"w1\" which appears several times. The very last instance where 'w' is followed by a digit is indeed \"w1\". \n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that is followed by a character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

However, in this case, the last 'w' is indeed the rightmost character, and there's no character after it. But looking closely, the last sequence is \"...i0r1i0r\" followed by no more 'w's before the end, but there is a sequence \"...i1w1i1...\" which indicates the last 'w' before the end of the string is actually followed by a '1'. \n\nHowever, upon re-examining the string closely for the rightmost 'w' that has a character after it, we find \"...i1w1i1i0i1r1i1i1i0i1r1i0i1r1i0i1i0i1w1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i1i1i0r1i0r1w1r1i1i1i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1r1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1w0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0i1w1i1r1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i0r\", the actual last 'w' with a digit after it is \"...i1w1...\". \n\nSo, the digit after the rightmost 'w' that has a character following it is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

But, considering the instruction to find the digit after the rightmost 'w' and given that the rightmost 'w' does not have a digit after it (as it's the last character), we should consider the instruction as looking for the last 'w' that has a character after it.\n\nUpon reevaluation for clarity and following the exact instruction to find the digit after the rightmost 'w' that has a subsequent character:\n\nThe string ends with \"...i1i1w0r0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1i1r\", and the last 'w' before the end that has characters after it is \"...w0r0...\". The digit immediately after this 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given string:\n\nInput: w1i0i0r1i1i0w0i0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1r0i1i0i1w0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0w1i1r1r1w1w1i1i0i0i1i0i1r1r1i0i0i0i1i0r1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1w1i0i1i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1w0i0r0i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i1i1w0w0i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0w1i0i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0r1i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i0i0i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the very end of the string, but since there's no character after the last 'w', we look at the second to last 'w'. However, the task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. The rightmost 'w' in the string is indeed at the end, and there's no digit after it because it's the last character. But considering the instruction to find the digit after the rightmost 'w' and given that the last 'w' does not have a digit after it, we should consider the 'w' before the last 'w' if we were to follow the instruction literally in a scenario where the 'w' is not the last character. \n\nHowever, the correct approach given the specific phrasing of the task and the provided options is to identify that the question seems to be asking for a digit that follows a 'w' character, implying we're looking for a scenario where 'w' is not the last character or considering the context might imply looking for the last 'w' that has a character after it. \n\nGiven the string ends with 'i1r', the last 'w' before this ending is followed by '1', which is a digit. \n\nThus, the correct answer, following the logic of finding a digit after a 'w' and given the options provided, would be based on the last 'w' that has a character following it, which leads to the digit '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}

However, looking closely, the last 'w' is not immediately followed by any digit because it's at the end. But since we need to find the digit after the rightmost 'w', we should consider the 'w's that are not at the very end but are still the rightmost among those not at the end. \n\nUpon closer inspection, the actual task is to find the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' that is not the last character in the string. Given the string ends with 'i0i1i1i0i0r', the last 'w' before this sequence is what we're interested in. However, my initial approach to directly identify the rightmost 'w' and its following digit was misguided due to the complexity and length of the string.\n\nCorrecting the approach:\n- The string is \"w0i1r0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0i1i0i0i1r0i0i0i1i1i1i1w1i1r1i1i1i1w1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0r1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i1i1w1i0r1i0i1w1r1w0r0i0i0i0i0i0i0w0i0i0i0i1i0w0i1i1i1r0r0i0i0i1i1i1r0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0w0w0i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i0i0i0r0i1i0i0i0i0r0i0i1r0i0i0i0i1r0i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i0w1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i0i0i0r1i1r1r1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0r\"\n\nThe last 'w' before the ending sequence is actually part of 'w1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i1r1i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r1i1i0i0i0i0i0r1i1r1r1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i0i0r'.
