Determine if this character is '0' or '1' to choose between options A and B.\n\nGiven the input string: w1i0i1r1i0i1i1i0i0r1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0r1i0r1i0i1i1i1i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1w1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1r1i1w0i0r0i0w0i1i1i0r0i0i1i1r0i0i1i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i0i1r0i1r0i0i1i0i1i1i1i1i0r0i1i0i1r0i1r0i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1r0i1i1i0i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1w1i1i0i0w1i0i0i0i0i0r1i0i0r1i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1w0i1w0r\n\nStarting from the right end of the string and moving left, we find the first 'w' which is part of 'w0r' at the very end. However, we need to check if there's another 'w' to the left of this one that could potentially be the rightmost 'w' in a sequence or standing alone. Upon inspection, there's indeed another 'w' just before '1w0r', but the very last 'w' is the one right before '0r'.\n\nSo, the rightmost 'w' is in 'w0r'. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}

However, there's no 'w' in this part. Continuing the search to the left, we find \"...w1i1i1i1i1w1i1r1...\". Here, we see a 'w' followed by '1'. But to ensure this is the rightmost 'w', let's continue looking left to confirm no other 'w' exists to the right of any other 'w'. \n\nUpon closer inspection of the entire string and moving left, we confirm that the sequence \"...w1i1...\" indeed contains the rightmost 'w'. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
