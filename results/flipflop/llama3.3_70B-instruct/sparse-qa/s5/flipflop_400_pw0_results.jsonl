But there's another 'w' even further to the right, in \"...i0w1i0r1...\". And actually, the very last 'w' is in \"...w0i...\", which appears multiple times, but the absolute last 'w' is indeed in one of these \"...w0...\" sequences.\n\nGiven the complexity and my initial misdirection, let's simplify: The last 'w' is indeed in a \"...w0...\" sequence. The character immediately after 'w' in this sequence is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
