Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven string: w1i1w1i1i0i1i1i0i0i0i0i0i1i0i1r1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1w0r0i0i1w0r\n\nStarting from the right end of the string and moving left, we find the first 'w' which is the rightmost. The string ends with \"...1w0r\", so the rightmost 'w' is in the position \"...1**w**0r\".\n\nThe character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is 0.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
