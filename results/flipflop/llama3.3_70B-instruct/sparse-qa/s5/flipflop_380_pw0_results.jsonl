The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string, but since there are multiple 'w's, we look for the last occurrence. Upon inspection, the last 'w' is indeed at the very end of the string, but there are several 'w's near the end. The actual last 'w' is part of \"w0\" which is not the very last characters, but close to the end. However, looking closely, the string actually ends with \"...i1i1i1i1i0i0r1r\", and there's a 'w' before this sequence. The correct sequence to look at is \"...w1i0i1i0i0i1w1i1i0i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0r1r\". The very last 'w' is in \"...i0i1i0i0i1w1...\". So, the 'w' in question is the one in \"i0i1i0i0i1w1\".\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
