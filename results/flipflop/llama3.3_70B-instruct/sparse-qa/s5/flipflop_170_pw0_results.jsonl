Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the string: w1i0i0i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i1i0i1i1i1i0i0i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i1i1i1r1r1i1i0i1r1r1i1i0r1i1r1i0i0i1w1i1r1i1i1i1i0i0i0i1w1i0w1r1i0i1i0r1i0i0i0i0r1r1i0r1w1i0r\n\nStarting from the right end of the string and moving left, we find the rightmost 'w' is in the position \"...w1i0r\".\n\nSo, the character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
