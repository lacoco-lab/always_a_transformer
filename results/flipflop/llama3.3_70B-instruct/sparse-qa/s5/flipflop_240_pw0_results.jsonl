Look at the character immediately to the right of this 'w'.\n\nGiven the input string: w1i1r1i0i0r1i0i1i1i0i1i1r1i0i0i0i0i1i0w1i0i1i0i0i1i0i0i1i1i0r1i1i0i1i1w0i1w0i0i1i1w0i0i0i0i0w0i0r0i1i1i1i0i0w0i0i0i0i1i1i0i1w0i0i0w0i1i0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0r0r0i1i0i1i0w1i0i0r1i1i1w0w0w0r0i1i0i1i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i1i0i0r0i0i1i1i1i1i0r0i1r\n\nLet's perform the steps:\n\n1. The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string \"...i1i1i1i0r0i1r\" is not correct since there are 'w's before this, the correct sequence to look for the last 'w' is from the end of the string towards the beginning. Upon inspection, we see the sequence \"...w0w0w0...\" and this is indeed towards the end of the string. The very last 'w' is in \"...w0w0w0r0...\".\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\n<answer>A</answer>"}
