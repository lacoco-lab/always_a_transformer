However, looking closely, the last 'w' is actually not followed by any characters since it's at the end. But if we look at the second to last 'w', it's also not followed by a digit immediately in a way that we can determine the answer based on the given options directly without considering the context of the question which asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. \n\nGiven the structure of the question, it seems we should consider the 'w' that has a digit immediately after it and is the rightmost among such 'w's. Upon reviewing the string again for the purpose of this task and the provided options, the focus should be on identifying a 'w' followed by a digit where that 'w' is as far to the right as possible and still has a digit after it.\n\nUpon a detailed review, one of the rightmost 'w's that has a digit immediately after it is \"...i0w1...\". Here, the 'w' is followed by '1'. \n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
