Given the task's constraints and for the sake of providing a meaningful response, it seems there might be an oversight in the task description or the input string provided. \n   - Assuming the task intends to mask a digit if present after 'w' and considering the provided string does not have a digit immediately after the last 'w', a strict interpretation would not find a digit to mask. However, to demonstrate the process with a meaningful outcome, let's adjust our approach to the spirit of the task: If we were to find a digit after any 'w', we would mask it. Since there's no digit after the last 'w', but there is after the first 'w', let's consider the general approach to masking digits after 'w' characters for educational purposes.\n\nGiven the input and the task's possible misinterpretation or the input string not aligning perfectly with the task's intent, the most straightforward interpretation (masking the digit after the rightmost 'w') does not apply directly because there is no digit after the rightmost 'w'. \n\nHowever, to demonstrate the masking process as per the task's probable intent (masking digits after 'w' characters), let's consider the first 'w' where a digit does follow:\n\nInput string with the first 'w' followed by a digit: w1r1i1i0r1i0w0i0i0r\n\n- The digit after the first 'w' is '1'. \n\nMasking this digit for demonstration purposes:\n\n<sequence_start>w<masked_digit>r1i1i0r1i0w0i0i0r<sequence_end>"}
