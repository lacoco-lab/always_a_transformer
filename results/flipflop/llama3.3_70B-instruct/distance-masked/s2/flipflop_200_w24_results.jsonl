Thus, the sequence remains unchanged in terms of masking a digit after 'w' because there isn't one. \n\nSo, the masked sequence, considering the task's specifics and the input provided, would still be the original string since there's no digit to mask after the last 'w'. Here it is, wrapped in the requested tags:\n\n<sequence_start>w1r1i0r1i1r1r1i1i1r1r1i0w1r1i1i1r1i0i0r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0i1i1i0r1r1r1i0i0i1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1r1i1i0i1i0i0i0i0r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r</sequence_end>\n\nNote: Given the nature of the task and the input string, the outcome might seem unexpected because the task implies an action (masking a digit) that cannot be performed due to the absence of a digit after the rightmost 'w'.<sequence_end>"}

Since the 'w' is at the end of the string \"w...r\", the digit after 'w' is 'r', but 'r' is not a digit. However, looking closely, I see that the string actually ends with \"...r0r\", meaning the last 'w' is followed by \"...r0r\". Thus, the digit immediately after the last 'w' is '0'.\n\nNow, I replace the identified digit '0' with '<masked_digit>'. \n\nHere is the masked sequence:\n<sequence_start>w0i0r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0w0i0i0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0i1r0i1i1r0i0i0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0i0i0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i1i1i0r0i1i1i0r0i0i1r0r0i1r0r0i0r0i1i1r0i0i1r0i1r0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1r0i0r0r0i1i0r0i1r<masked_digit>r</sequence_end>\n\nThe task is now complete.<sequence_end>"}
