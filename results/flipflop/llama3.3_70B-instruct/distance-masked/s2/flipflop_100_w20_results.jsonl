The correct masking should thus directly follow the last 'w' in the sequence, which is not followed by any digit in the original string as it's the last character. Given the original task's specifics and the input string provided, the rightmost 'w' is at the very end, and there's no digit after it to mask. The task as described doesn't apply in the conventional sense since there's no digit immediately after the last 'w' to replace. \n\nGiven the input string ends with \"r1i0i1i0r\" and the last 'w' is before these characters, the correct approach is to find the last 'w' and then mask the digit immediately after it. The last 'w' in the string is actually \"w1\" where '1' is the digit after 'w'. Thus, the correct masking should replace this '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nCorrected approach:\n- Find the last occurrence of 'w' which is in \"w1\".\n- The digit after 'w' is '1'.\n- Replace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nCorrected string:\n<sequence_start>w<masked_digit>r1i0i1i0i0r1i0r1i0w is incorrect since we are looking for the last 'w' and then masking the digit after it. The correct string to consider for the last 'w' and the digit after it is actually the sequence where the last 'w' appears, which upon a detailed review, requires identifying the last 'w' and then applying the mask to the digit that follows it, which in the sequence provided, means looking for the 'w' that is not at the end but before the digits that follow, which leads to the realization that the task involves directly modifying the string based on the last 'w' and the digit that immediately follows it.\n\nUpon a thorough review and application of the task's requirements:\nThe correct masking should occur at the position of the last 'w' followed by a digit. Given the structure of the input, the focus should be on the sequence where 'w' is not the last character but is followed by a digit that needs to be masked.\n\nThus, considering the input string and the requirement to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', the task involves identifying the correct position and applying the mask. \n\nGiven the input and the steps to follow, the accurate masking requires understanding the sequence and the position of the last 'w' that is followed by a digit. \n\nThe final answer is: \n<sequence_start>w1r1i0i1i0i0r1i0r1i0w<masked_digit>i1i1r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i0i0r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0i1i0r</sequence_end><sequence_end>"}

Identifying the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - After finding the rightmost 'w', the next character is checked.\n   - If the next character is a digit, it is identified for masking.\n\nLet's perform these steps on the given input string:\n\nInput string: w1r1i1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1w0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r\n\nUpon scanning the string from right to left, the rightmost 'w' is found. The digit immediately after this 'w' is '0'.\n\nNow, replacing '0' with '<masked_digit>':\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw1r1i1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1w0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0<masked_digit>\n\nHowever, the correct approach should involve actually finding the last 'w' and then masking the digit that follows it. Let's correct the process and apply it accurately:\n\nThe input string is: w1r1i1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1w0i1i0r0i1i0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r\n\nThe last 'w' in the string is actually part of 'w0', where '0' is the digit that needs to be masked.\n\nSo, the correct masking should result in:\nw1r1i1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1w<masked_digit>i1i0r0i1i0i0r0r0r0r0i0i0i0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1i0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0i0i0r0r\n\nThus, the masked sequence, correctly placed between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}

Identifying the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - After finding the rightmost 'w', the next character is checked.\n   - If the next character is a digit, it is identified for masking.\n\nLet's perform these steps on the given input string:\n\nInput string: w1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1i1r1w1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is the second 'w' in the string: ...w1...\n\nThe digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\nNow, replacing '1' with '<masked_digit>':\n\nThe modified string becomes: w<masked_digit>r1r1i1i0i0r1r1i1r1w<masked_digit>r1r1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r\n\nHowever, the correct replacement should only occur once at the rightmost 'w' position. The initial 'w1' should remain unchanged, and only the second 'w1' should be modified to 'w<masked_digit>'.\n\nCorrected approach:\n- The original string is: w1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1i1r1w1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r\n- The rightmost 'w' is in the position: ...w1...\n- Replacing only the '1' after the rightmost 'w' with '<masked_digit>':\n  \nThe correct modified string is: w1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1i1r1w<masked_digit>r1r1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r\n\nThus, the masked sequence is:\n<sequence_start>w1r1r1i1i0i0r1r1i1r1w<masked_digit>r1r1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r<sequence_end>"}
