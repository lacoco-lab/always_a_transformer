Given the 'w' is at the end, the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there is no digit to mask. \n\nHowever, to follow the instructions to the letter as requested and provide a response in the required format, I will proceed under the assumption that the task is to be interpreted in a way that allows for a response, even though the conditions cannot be met as described.\n\nGiven the unique circumstances, the \"masked sequence\" would technically be the input string itself, as there's no digit to mask after the last 'w'. But to adhere strictly to the format requested without deviating from the instruction to provide a response:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i0r0r0r0r0i1i1r0i0i0i1w0i0r0r0i0i0r0r0i1r0i0i0r0i1i1i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0i1r0i1i0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i0i1r0i1i1r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i0r0i1i0r</sequence_end>\n\nPlease note, this response is provided to meet the format requirement, acknowledging the task's conditions cannot be fulfilled as traditionally interpreted.<sequence_end>"}

Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\nInput string: w0i1r0i0i0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0w1i0i0r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1i0r1i1i1r1r1i0i0i0i0r1r1r1r1i0i0i0r\n\n1. Find the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe rightmost 'w' character is at the position where the string ends with \"...i0i0i0r1r1r1r1i0i0i0r\" before it, the last 'w' is \"w1\".\n\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character is '1'.\n\n3. Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag:\nReplace '1' with <masked_digit>.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' character masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w0i1r0i0i0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0w<masked_digit>i0i0r1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0i1i1i1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i0i1i0r1i1i1r1r1i0i0i0i0r1r1r1r1i0i0i0r<sequence_end>"}
