Given the strict interpretation of the task, if there's no digit immediately after 'w', the task as described doesn't apply directly. But to follow through with an example of how masking would work if a digit were present, let's adjust our understanding:\n   - If we were to find a digit after a 'w', we would replace it. Since there's no digit after the last 'w', we look at the structure of the task to provide a meaningful response.\n\nGiven the input and the task's specifics, since there's no digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' to mask, the original string doesn't meet the condition for masking as described. However, to demonstrate the process with an adjustment for clarity:\n\nIf the input were \"w1r1r1i0w01\" (adding a digit after the last 'w'), the masked sequence would be:\n<sequence_start>w1r1r1i0w<masked_digit>1<sequence_end>"}
