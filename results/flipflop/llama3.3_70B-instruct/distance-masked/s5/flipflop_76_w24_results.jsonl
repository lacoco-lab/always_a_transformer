Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\nInput string: w0r0i0i1r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1w1r1r1i0i0i0i0r1r1i1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1i1r\n\n1. Finding the rightmost 'w' character:\n   - The string is scanned from right to left to find the last occurrence of 'w'.\n   - The rightmost 'w' is found at the position where 'w1' is present.\n\n2. Identifying the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - The digit immediately after 'w' in 'w1' is '1'.\n\n3. Masking the digit:\n   - Replace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw0r0i0i1r0i0r0r0r0i0r0i1w<masked_digit>r1r1i0i0i0i0r1r1i1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1i1r\n\nNow, placing the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
