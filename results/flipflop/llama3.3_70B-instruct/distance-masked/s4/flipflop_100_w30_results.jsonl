So the digit after 'w' is '0'.\n\nThe masked sequence is therefore:\n<sequence_start>w<masked_digit>i1r0r0i1i1r0i1i1i0r0r0i0i0r0w0i0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i0r0i1r0i0i1i0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1i1i1r0r<sequence_end>"}

The correct sequence to mask is the '0' directly after the last 'w', which is part of the sequence 'w0' near the end.\n\nCorrecting the approach based on the accurate location of the rightmost 'w' and the digit following it:\n\nInput: w0r0r0r0i0i1r0r0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0w0i0r0i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0i0i1r0r\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in 'w0' before 'i0r0i0r0i1i0i0i1i0i0r0i0i0i1r0i0i1r0r0r0i1i1i0i0r0i0r0r0i1r0i0i1r0r'.
