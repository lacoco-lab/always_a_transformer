Identifying the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - The digit immediately after \"w0\" is 'r', but since 'r' is not a digit, we look at the next character.\n   - However, the task is to mask the digit after the 'w', and in this context, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis because 'r' is indeed the character immediately following 'w0', and it's not a digit. The correct approach should involve looking for a digit after the last 'w', which in this case, is not directly after 'w0' but we need to consider the sequence properly.\n\nGiven the sequence and the requirement to mask a digit after 'w', and realizing the mistake in the initial step-by-step logic due to the presence of 'r' after 'w0', let's correct the approach:\n\nThe correct sequence to consider after the last 'w' is \"0r0r0i1i1r0i1i0r0i0i0i1r\". Here, the digit immediately after the 'w' (considering 'w0' as the point of reference) is indeed '0', which is part of 'w0'. The task, however, asks for the digit after the 'w', implying we look for a digit following the sequence 'w0', which would be the next digit in the sequence, not necessarily immediately after 'w' if 'w' is followed by a non-digit character. But since 'w' is directly followed by '0', a digit, the initial interpretation was slightly misaligned with the task's specifics.\n\nCorrecting for the misunderstanding and following the task's literal interpretation to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is in \"w0\", and the digit after this 'w' is '0'. Thus, the correct action is to mask this '0'.\n\nMasked sequence: w<masked_digit>r0r0i1i1r0i1i0r0i0i0i1r\n\nTherefore, the final masked sequence, following the task's instructions and correcting for the initial misinterpretation, is:\n\n<sequence_start>w<masked_digit>r0r0i1i1r0i1i0r0i0i0i1r<sequence_end>"}
