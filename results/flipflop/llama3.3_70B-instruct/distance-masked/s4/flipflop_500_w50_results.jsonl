However, this task requires masking a digit after the rightmost 'w'. Given the string ends with 'r1r', the last 'w' is actually not at the very end but rather before a series of characters. The correct approach is to find the last 'w' and then mask the digit immediately following it.\n\nUpon reevaluation:\nThe last 'w' in the string is followed by '1', which is the digit to be masked.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\nThe digit '1' immediately after the last 'w' should be replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the corrected approach to the task:\n\n1. Find the last occurrence of 'w' in the string.\n2. The digit immediately after this 'w' is '1'.\n3. Replace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precision in locating the last 'w' and the subsequent digit, the task involves a detailed examination of the string. The last 'w' is followed by '1', which needs to be masked.\n\nThe corrected string with the digit after the last 'w' masked is:\n<sequence_start>w0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0i0i1i1i1i0r0i1i1r0i0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0w<masked_digit>r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1i1r1i1i0i1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i0i1r1i0i1i0r1i0i1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i0r1r1r1i0i1i0i0i0i1i0i1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0r1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i0r1r1i0r1i0i0i1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1r1i0i1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1i0i0r1i1i1i1r1r1i1i0i0i0i1i1r1i1i1r1r1i0i1i0r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1i0i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1r1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1i1i1r1i0r1i0i0r1i0i0r1r1r<sequence_end>"}

After searching, we find that the last 'w' is not at the very end but rather before the last set of characters.\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\nAfter finding the rightmost 'w', we look at the character immediately after it, which is '1'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\nWe replace the '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i0r1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i1i0r1r1i0i1w1r1i1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i1i1i1i0i1i0r1i1i0r1i1i0i1i0r1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0i1i0i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1i0i1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1i0r1w<masked_digit>i1i1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1r1i1r1r1i0i1i1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1i1i0r1i1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i0i1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1i1r1i1i1i1i0i1i0r1i1i0r1i1i0i1i0r1r1i1i1i1i1r1i1r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i1i1i1i0i1r1i0i1i0i1i1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0i1i0i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1i0i1r1r1i0r1i1r1i1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i0i1r1i1r1r1i0i1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i0r1i0i0r1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r<sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I found that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string, and it is followed by the digit '1'.\n\nThe digit after the rightmost 'w' is '1'. I will replace this digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\n\nHere is the modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked:\n<sequence_start>w0r0i1r0i1r0i0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i0i0r0r0r0i1r0i1w1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1i0i1r1i1r1r1i1i1i1r1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0i0r1i0r1i0r1i0i0i0i1r1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1i1i1i0r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0i0r1r1i1i0r1i0i1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i0i0i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i1i0i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0r1r<masked_digit></sequence_end>\n\nThe final answer is: \n<sequence_start>w0r0i1r0i1r0i0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0i0r0i0i0r0r0r0i1r0i1w1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1i0i0r1i0i1r1i1r1r1i1i1i1r1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0i0r1i0r1i0r1i0i0i0i1r1r1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i1i1i1r1r1r1i0r1r1i0i1i0i1r1i1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i1r1r1i1i1i0r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1r1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1i0i1i0i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i1i1i0r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i0i0i0r1r1i1i0r1i0i1i1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i1r1r1i0r1i0i0i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i0r1i1i0i1i0i0r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i1r1i0r1r<masked_digit></sequence_end><sequence_end>"}

After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"w1i1...r1r\".\n\nNext, I identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character, which is '1'.\n\nNow, I replace the identified digit '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' character masked is:\nw1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0i0i1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1i0r1r1i0r1i1w1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i1r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1i1i0i1i1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i0i0i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1i1i1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i0r1i0i1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1w<masked_digit>i1... (rest of the string remains the same)\n\nHowever, upon re-examining my approach for accuracy in following the instructions to the letter, I realized the correct masking should directly replace the digit following the last 'w' without adding extra characters or altering the string's original structure beyond the specified replacement.\n\nGiven the input string ends with \"r1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i0r1i0i1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1w1i1...r1r\", the correct action is to mask the '1' that immediately follows the last 'w', resulting in the string ending with \"...r1w<masked_digit>i1...\".\n\nHere is the corrected approach to provide the masked sequence as requested:\n\n<sequence_start>w1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0i0i1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1i0r1r1i0r1i1w1i1i0i1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1r1r1i0i1i0i1r1i0i1i1r1r1i1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i1r1i1i0i0r1r1i0r1i0r1r1i1i0i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i0r1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1i1i0r1i0i1i1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1i1r1i0r1i1i0i1i1i0r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1i0r1i0i0i1i0i0i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1i0i1r1r1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1i1i1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0r1i1i0r1i0i1r1i0r1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1i0r1i0i1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1w<masked_digit>i1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1i1i1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0<sequence_end>"}
