Find the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the 16th position (0-indexed) in the string \"w0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0w0r\".\n\n2. Identify the digit after the rightmost 'w':\nThe character immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '0', which is a digit.\n\n3. Mask the digit:\nReplace '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string is: w0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0w<masked_digit>r\n\nNow, I will put the masked sequence between '<sequence_start>' and '<sequence_end>"}
