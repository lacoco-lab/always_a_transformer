However, following the task's instruction to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w', and considering the 'w' is the last character, the task as described cannot be completed in the traditional sense because there is no digit to mask. \n\nHowever, to adhere to the task's request as closely as possible and provide a meaningful response, I will interpret the task as requiring the identification of the rightmost 'w' and then handle the absence of a following digit by indicating that there is no digit to mask.\n\nGiven the input string ends with 'r0r' and not a 'w' followed by a digit, the actual last 'w' in the sequence is not followed by any digit as it's not present at the very end. The last 'w' is in the sequence \"...w0r0...\". Thus, the digit after the last 'w' that is not at the end of the string is '0'.\n\nSo, the corrected approach to mask the digit after the rightmost 'w' (which is not at the end of the string) would be:\n\nInput with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked: w<masked_digit>r0i1i1r0r0r0r0i0i0i1r0w0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1i0r0i1i1r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0r\n\n<sequence_start>w<masked_digit>r0i1i1r0r0r0r0i0i0i1r0w0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1r0r0i0i0i1r0i1r0r0i1r0r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i0i0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0i0i1i0r0i1i1r0i1i1r0r0r0i0r0r<sequence_end>"}

Find the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe input string is scanned from right to left to find the rightmost 'w'. The rightmost 'w' is found at the position where 'w' appears last in the string.\n\n2. Identify the digit after the rightmost 'w':\nAfter finding the rightmost 'w', the next character is checked. If it's a digit, it will be replaced with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nLet's perform these steps on the given input string:\n\nThe rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string \"r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0i1r\". The character after 'w' in \"w1r...\" is '1', but since we are looking for the rightmost 'w', we consider the last occurrence of 'w' which is not followed by any digits in this case, it is at the end. However, upon re-examining the string, it appears the description was misunderstood. The correct approach should involve finding the last 'w' and then masking the digit immediately following it, if any.\n\nUpon re-evaluation:\n- The string is \"w1r1i0i1i1r1i0i0r1i1i0r1w0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0i1r\"\n- The rightmost 'w' is in \"r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0i1r\" which is incorrect as per the initial analysis. The correct last 'w' is actually \"w0\".\n\nSo, the correct sequence to consider for masking is \"w0\". The digit after 'w' is '0'.\n\nNow, replace '0' with '<masked_digit>':\nThe resulting string after masking the digit following the rightmost 'w' is:\n\"w<masked_digit>r0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0i1r\"\n\nHowever, the initial analysis incorrectly identified the position and process. Given the correct understanding of the task:\n\nThe input string with the last 'w' followed by '0', which should be masked, results in the string:\n\"w1r1i0i1i1r1i0i0r1i1i0r1w<masked_digit>r0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0i1i0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1r0r0i1i0r0i0r0r0r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1r0i1i1i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0i1r\"\n\nGiven the correct process and the actual string provided, the task involves finding the last 'w', which is indeed \"w0\", and masking the '0'. The correct output with the masked sequence between '<sequence_start>' and '<sequence_end>"}
