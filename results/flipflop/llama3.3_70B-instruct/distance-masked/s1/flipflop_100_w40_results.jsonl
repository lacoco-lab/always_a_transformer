Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character:\nThe digit immediately after the 'w' is '0'.\n\n3. Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag:\nReplace '0' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw0r0r0i0r0r0r0i1i0r0i0i0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1i1w<masked_digit>r0r0r0r0i1i1i1i0r0i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0i0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0i0r\n\nNow, I will put the masked sequence between '<sequence_start>' and '<sequence_end>"}
