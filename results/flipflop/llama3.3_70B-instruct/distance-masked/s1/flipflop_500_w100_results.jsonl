However, the task requires masking a digit after 'w'. Given the input ends with 'r', we must consider the 'w' before the last sequence of characters. The second rightmost 'w' is: ...r1i0w0i0i0r0i1i1r0...\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\nThe digit after the second rightmost 'w' is '0'.
