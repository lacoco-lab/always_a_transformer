Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\n\nHere is the algorithmic solution:\n\nInput string: w0r0i1r0i1r0i0i0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0r0w1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i0i1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1r1r1i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1r1r1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0r\n\nStep 1: Find the rightmost 'w' character.\nThe rightmost 'w' character is at the end of the string: ...r1i0r\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\nThere is no digit after the last 'w' since it's at the end, but the 'w' is followed by '1' in the sequence \"w1\". So the digit after the rightmost 'w' in the sequence is '1'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\nReplace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the masked sequence:\n<sequence_start>w0r0i1r0i1r0i0i0r0r0i1r0i1r0i0i1i1r0i0i0i1r0r0r0r0w<masked_digit>r1r1r1r1i0i1r1r1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i0i1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1i0i0r1i1i1i1i0i0i1r1r1r1i0i0i0i1r1i0i1i0i1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1i1i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1i0r1r1i0i1r1r1r1r1r1i0i1r1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0i1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i1i1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i0i0r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i1i0i1r1i0i0i0i1i0i0i1r1r1i1i0i0i1i1r1i0r<sequence_end>"}
