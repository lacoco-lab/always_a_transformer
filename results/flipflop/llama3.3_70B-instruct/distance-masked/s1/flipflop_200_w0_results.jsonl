Find the rightmost 'w' character in the input string.\n2. Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with the <masked_digit> tag.\n\nHere is the input string: w0r0i0i1i1r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i0i1r0i0i0r0i1i0i1i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i0i1r0r0r0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0r0i1r\n\nFirst, I find the rightmost 'w' character. After examining the string, I find that the rightmost 'w' is at the end of the string, and there are no digits after it. However, upon closer inspection, I realize that there are multiple 'w' characters, and the rightmost one is not followed by any digits. The last 'w' is actually followed by the end of the string. \n\nSince the task requires masking a digit after the rightmost 'w', and there are no digits after the last 'w', I will look for the second to last 'w' and mask the digit after it if it exists.\n\nUpon re-examining the string, I find that the second to last 'w' is also not followed by any digits. This pattern continues until I find a 'w' that is followed by a digit.\n\nAfter re-examining the string again, I found a 'w' followed by a digit: w0. However, this 'w' is not the rightmost 'w'. The rightmost 'w' is actually the last character in the string, and it's not followed by any digits.\n\nSince the task requires masking a digit after the rightmost 'w', and there are no digits after the last 'w', the task as stated cannot be completed because there is no digit to mask after the rightmost 'w'. \n\nHowever, if we consider the last 'w' that is followed by a digit, we can mask that digit. The last 'w' that is followed by a digit is 'w0'. The digit after this 'w' is '0'. \n\nIf we were to mask this digit, the resulting string would be: w<masked_digit>r0i0i1i1r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i0i1r0i0i0r0i1i0i1i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i0i1r0r0r0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0r0i1r\n\nBut since this is not the rightmost 'w', and the rightmost 'w' is not followed by any digits, the correct output according to the task is the original string with no changes, because there is no digit to mask after the rightmost 'w'. \n\nSo the final output is:\n<sequence_start>w0r0i0i1i1r0i1i1r0r0i1r0i1i0i0r0r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i0i1r0i0i0r0i1i0i1i0r0r0i1i1r0r0i0r0i0i0i1r0i0i1i1r0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0r0r0i0i0r0r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i1i0i1r0r0r0i0i1i0i1i0i1r0r0i1r<sequence_end>"}
