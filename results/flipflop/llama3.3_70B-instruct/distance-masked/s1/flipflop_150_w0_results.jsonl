Therefore, the rightmost 'w' character is at the beginning of the string.\n\nStep 2: Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\nThe digit immediately after the 'w' character is '1'.\n\nStep 3: Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\nReplace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere is the modified string:\nw<masked_digit>r1r1r1i1i1i0i1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1r1i1r1i1i0r1r1i0i0r1i0i0r1r1i1i1r1i1i0r1i1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0i1i0i1i1r1r1r1i0i0r1i0i1i0r1i1r1i1i0i1i0r1i1i1r1i0i1i0i0i0r1i0r\n\nNow, I will put the modified string between the '<sequence_start>' and '<sequence_end>"}
