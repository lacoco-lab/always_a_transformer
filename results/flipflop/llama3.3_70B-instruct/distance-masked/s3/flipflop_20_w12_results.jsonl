Given the task's specifics, it seems we are to mask the digit immediately following the rightmost 'w' if one exists. Since 'i' is not a digit, the task as described does not apply directly because there's no digit to mask after the last 'w'. But to follow instructions as closely as possible and assuming the intent was to demonstrate the process:\n   - If we were to find a digit after a 'w', we would replace it. However, in this case, the character after 'w0' is 'i', not a digit.\n\nGiven the input and the task's specifics, the rightmost 'w' is followed by 'i', not a digit. Therefore, the task as described cannot be completed because there is no digit to mask after the rightmost 'w'.
