Replace the identified digit with the '<masked_digit>' tag.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\nInput string: w1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1i1i0w1r1r1i0i1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r\n\n1. Finding the rightmost 'w' character:\n   - The input string is scanned from right to left to find the last occurrence of 'w'.\n   - The rightmost 'w' is found at the position where 'w' appears just before '1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r'.\n\n2. Identifying the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - The digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n3. Masking the digit:\n   - Replace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is:\nw1r1r1r1r1i1i1i0r1r1i1i0w1r1r1i0i1r1r1i0i0r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r<masked_digit>r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r1r\n\nNow, placing the masked sequence between '<sequence_start>' and '<sequence_end>"}
