Identify the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' character.\n3. Replace the identified digit with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\nInput string: w1r1r1i0w0i1r0i1i0r\n\n1. Finding the rightmost 'w' character:\n   - The string is scanned from left to right to find all 'w' characters and their positions.\n   - Positions of 'w' characters are noted: w1 (at position 0), w0 (at position 7).\n   - The rightmost 'w' is at position 7.\n\n2. Identifying the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - The character immediately after 'w0' (at position 7) is 'i' (at position 8), which is not a digit.\n   - However, since the task asks for the digit after the 'w', and there's no digit immediately after 'w0', we need to clarify the approach based on the given instructions. Given the strict interpretation of the task, if there's no digit immediately after 'w', the task as described doesn't specify what to do. But since the goal is to mask a digit after 'w' and there's no digit after the last 'w', we should consider the context and either find the closest digit after 'w' in the string or conclude that the task cannot be completed as specified.\n\nGiven the confusion and to provide a meaningful response, let's adjust our approach to either find the closest digit after the last 'w' or acknowledge that the task's conditions aren't met. In this case, since 'i' is not a digit and there are no more characters after 'i' that are digits in a straightforward sequence, the task as described (masking the digit immediately after 'w') cannot be directly completed because there is no digit immediately following the last 'w'.

Finding the rightmost 'w' character:\n   - The string is scanned from left to right to find all 'w' characters and their positions.\n   - Positions of 'w' characters: 0, 7\n   - The rightmost 'w' is at position 7.\n\n2. Identifying the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - The character after the 'w' at position 7 is '1'.\n\n3. Masking the digit:\n   - Replace '1' with '<masked_digit>'.\n\nThe modified string with the digit after the rightmost 'w' masked is: w0r0i0i0w<masked_digit>i1r1i0i0r\n\nNow, I will put the masked sequence between <sequence_start> and <sequence_end>"}
