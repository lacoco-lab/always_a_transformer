The character immediately after 'write' is '1'.\n\nHowever, we need to check if there's another 'write' instruction. Since we started from the end and moved backwards, the first 'write' we found is indeed the rightmost one in the context of the entire string, but we should confirm if it's the only one or the last one from the end. \n\nUpon closer inspection, we realize the string starts with 'write', and there are no other 'write' instructions after it. Thus, the 'write' at the start is indeed the rightmost 'write' when considering the string from left to right, but since we're looking from right to left for the \"rightmost\" in terms of last occurrence, our initial approach already identifies the correct 'write' due to its singular occurrence.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'write' instruction is '1'.\n\n<answer>B</answer>"}
