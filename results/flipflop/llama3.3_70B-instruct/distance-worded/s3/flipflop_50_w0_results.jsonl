The string ends with \"...read0read0read\", so we move backwards until we find 'write'. \n\nUpon searching, we find that the last occurrence of 'write' is at the beginning of the string: \"write0...\". However, we need to ensure there aren't any other 'write' instructions closer to the end. After a thorough check, it's confirmed that the last 'write' is indeed followed by '0', but to follow the instructions precisely and ensure no 'write' is missed, let's confirm the sequence:\n\n- The string starts with \"write0\", indicating the first 'write' is followed by '0'.\n- Moving forward, we find other 'write' instructions are not present; the sequence is dominated by 'read' and 'ignore' instructions.\n\nGiven the task's requirement to find the digit after the **rightmost** 'write' and the provided string starting with \"write0\", it indicates the rightmost 'write' in terms of the last occurrence before the end of the string is actually not present, as 'write' appears at the start. However, the task implies finding the last 'write' before the string ends, which in a typical scenario would involve searching from the end. Since 'write' is not found towards the end, and the string begins with 'write0', the digit after the 'write' at the start is '0'. But, adhering strictly to the task's wording about the \"rightmost 'write' instruction,\" and considering the string's structure, the critical insight is recognizing the task's aim is to identify the last 'write' before the end of the string, which is not explicitly present in a manner that suggests a 'write' near the end. Thus, the interpretation hinges on understanding \"rightmost\" in the context of the string's provided structure and the instructions given.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
