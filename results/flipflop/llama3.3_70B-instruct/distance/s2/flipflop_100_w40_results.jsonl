The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string: ...r0r0r0r0i0i1i1i0i1r0r0r0r\n2. There's no 'w' at the very end, my mistake. Let me re-evaluate: The string actually ends with ...r0r0r0r, and the last 'w' is before a series of characters. The correct last 'w' is in ...w0r0r0i0r0i1i0i1i0r0i0i0r0r0i1r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1i1i0i1r0r0r0r. So, the 'w' in question is followed by '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
