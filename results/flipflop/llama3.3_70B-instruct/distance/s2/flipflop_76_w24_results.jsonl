Then, we will find the character immediately to its right, which should be the digit we are looking for.\n\nGiven Input: w1i0i1i1i1i0r1r1i0r1r1i1w1i1i1r1i0i1i1r1i1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i1r\n\n1. Locate the rightmost 'w':\n   - Starting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning, we find the last 'w'.\n\n2. The string with the rightmost 'w' marked (for clarity, let's say the string is indexed and the rightmost 'w' is at position X, but since this is a text-based explanation, we'll proceed conceptually):\n   - Upon inspection, the rightmost 'w' is followed by '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
