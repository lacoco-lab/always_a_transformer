Let's correct this and actually find the last 'w' in the string.\n\nThe correct approach is to scan the string from left to right and keep track of the last 'w' encountered:\n\n- The string starts with \"w0...\", so the first 'w' is at the beginning.\n- Scanning through, we find another 'w' later in the string: \"...r0w0i0...\".\n\nThis 'w' is the last one in the string. The character immediately after it is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
