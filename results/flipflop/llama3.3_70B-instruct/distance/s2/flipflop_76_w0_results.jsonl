Find the last occurrence of 'w' in the string.\n2. Check the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If the character is a digit (0 or 1), print it.\n\nHere's how I'll do it:\n\nThe input string is: w1r1i1r1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i1r1r1r\n\nFirst, I find the last 'w'. The string ends with \"...r1r1r\", so I look backwards: \"...i0i1r1r1r\" still no 'w', \"...i0r1i1r1r1i0...\" still no 'w', \"...r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i1r1r1r\" still no 'w', \"...i1r1i1r1i1r1i1i1r1i1r1r1r1i0i1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i0r1i1r1r1i0i1r1r1r\" and then I see it at the very beginning: \"w1...\".\n\nSo, the last 'w' is actually the first character, and the digit immediately to its right is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
