However, since the task is to find the digit after the **rightmost** 'w', and given the structure of the string, we can deduce that 'w' appears only at the beginning of the string as \"w0...\". This is because there's no other 'w' visible in the provided string except for the one at the start.\n\n2. **Find the digit after 'w'**: Since 'w' is followed by \"0\" as per the start of the string \"w0...\", the digit immediately after the rightmost 'w' (which is the only 'w' in this context) is \"0\".\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Let's re-evaluate: The string starts with \"w0...\", indicating the first character is 'w'. Given the nature of the task, it seems we are to consider the first occurrence from the left as the basis of our search since there's no 'w' later in the string that we can consider as \"rightmost\" in a practical sense for this task. Thus, the rightmost 'w' in terms of the task's apparent oversight is actually the first 'w'.\n\n2. **Find the digit after 'w'**: Since 'w' is the first character, the digit immediately after it is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
