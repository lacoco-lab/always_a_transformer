Find the rightmost 'w':\n   - Starting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning, we find the last 'w' which is part of \"i1w1\".\n\n2. Identify the character after the rightmost 'w':\n   - The character immediately after 'w' in \"i1w1\" is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
