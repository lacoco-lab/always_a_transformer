Let's look again from the start to ensure we didn't miss it: The string starts with \"w\" and there is another 'w' later in the string. The last 'w' is actually: ...r0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0i0r0i1i0i1i1r is not correct, we need to find the last 'w'. Upon re-examining, we see the string: ...w0r0r0r0i0r0r0r0r0i0i1i0r0r0r0i0i0r0r0i0i1r0r0r0r0i0r0i0r0r0r0i1i1i1r0r0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0i0r0i1i0i1i1r. The 'w' here is the last 'w' in the string.\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the last 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
