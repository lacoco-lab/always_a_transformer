Find the rightmost 'w':\n   - Starting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning, we find the last occurrence of 'w'.\n\n2. The string with the rightmost 'w' marked (for clarity, assuming the string is indexed from 0):\n   - The rightmost 'w' is at a position near the end. To simplify, let's find it:\n     - The input string is: w0r0r0r0i0i1i0i1i1r0w0i0i0r0r0i0r0i0r0i0r0i1r0i1i0i1r0i1r0r0r0i0r0i1r0r0r0r0i1r0i0i1r0i1i1r0i0r0r0r\n     - The last 'w' is in \"r0w0\" which is towards the beginning of the second half of the string.\n\n3. Identify the character after the rightmost 'w':\n   - Once the rightmost 'w' is located, we look at the character immediately to its right.\n   - In \"r0w0\", the 'w' is followed by '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
