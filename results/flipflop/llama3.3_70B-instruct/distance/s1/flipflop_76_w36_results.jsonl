Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is a digit (0 or 1), print it.\n\nGiven Input: w0r0i1i0r0r0i1i0i1i0i0i0r0r0i0r0i1r0w1i0i1r1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i1r\n\nLet's perform the task:\n\n1. The string is scanned from right to left to find the rightmost 'w'.\n2. The rightmost 'w' is found at the position before '1i0i1r1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i1r', which means the 'w' in question is the last 'w' in the string: \"...w1i0i1r1i0i0i1r1i1i1i1i1r1i0r1r1i1i1i1r\"\n3. The character immediately to the right of this 'w' is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
