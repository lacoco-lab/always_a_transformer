Find the rightmost 'w': Starting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning, we find the first occurrence of 'w'. In this case, there is only one 'w' which is at the beginning, so it's the rightmost 'w' by default.\n\n2. The position of 'w' is at index 0 (since indexing starts at 0).\n\n3. Look at the character immediately to the right of 'w': The character at index 1 is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}

Find the rightmost 'w':\n   - Starting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning, we look for 'w'.\n   - The string ends with \"...i1r0r\", so we move backwards.\n   - Upon searching, we find that the last occurrence of 'w' is at the very beginning of the string: \"w0...\".\n\n2. Identify the digit after the rightmost 'w':\n   - Since 'w' is at the start of the string, the character immediately after it is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
