Find the rightmost 'w' in the string.\n2. Once found, look at the character immediately to the right of 'w'.\n3. If that character is a digit (0 or 1), print it.\n\nGiven the input string: w0r0i0r0i1i1i0i1r0r0i0r0w0i0i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1r0r0i1r0i1r0r0i1i1i0i1i0i1r0i1r0r0r0i1r0i0i1i0r0i1i0i1r0i1i1i1i1r0r0i0i0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0r0i0i1i1i0r0r0i0i1r\n\nLet's perform the task:\n\n1. The rightmost 'w' is found at the end of the string: ...0i1r (there's no 'w' at the very end, we need to look from the end towards the start) ... upon searching from right to left, we find 'w' in \"r0w\".\n\n2. The character immediately to the right of the rightmost 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
