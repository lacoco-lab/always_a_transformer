The last occurrence of 'w' is at the 9th position (since indexing starts at 0, and 'w' appears first at position 0 and then again at position 8, considering the string starts as \"w1...\").\n2. The character immediately to the right of the last 'w' (which is at position 8) is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
