Yet, the specific request for the digit after the **rightmost** 'w' poses a challenge since the rightmost 'w' is not followed by a digit but rather by the end of the string or non-digit characters in the provided context.\n\nThus, adhering to the format requested but acknowledging the potential for confusion or a need for clarification in the task:\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}

If the character after 'w' is a digit (0 or 1), print that digit.\n\nGiven Input: w0r0i1i1r0r0r0r0r0r0i1i0i0i1r0w1r1r1i1i1r1i1i1r1i0i0i0r1i1i0r1i0i1r1i1i0r1r1i0r1r1r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1r\n\nStarting from the end and moving towards the beginning, we find the rightmost 'w' and the character after it is '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
