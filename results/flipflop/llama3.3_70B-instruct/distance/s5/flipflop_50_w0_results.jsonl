If that character is a digit (0 or 1), print it.\n\nGiven Input: w0i1i0i1r0r0r0i1r0i1i1i1i0i0i0r0i0i1i1r0r0i1i0i1r\n\nLet's perform the task:\n\n1. The string is scanned from right to left to find the rightmost 'w'.\n2. The rightmost 'w' is found at the beginning of the string, and there are no other 'w's to its right since it's the only 'w' in the string.\n3. The character immediately to the right of 'w' is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the rightmost 'w' is 0.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
