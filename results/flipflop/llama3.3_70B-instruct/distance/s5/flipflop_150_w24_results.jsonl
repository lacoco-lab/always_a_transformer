Find the last 'w': Starting from the end of the string, we find the last 'w' is at the very end of the string, which means there's no character after it. However, upon closer inspection, it seems I need to correct the approach based on the actual task requirement.\n\n2. Correct Approach: The task asks for the digit after the rightmost 'w'. If 'w' is at the end, there's no digit after it to print. However, in this case, I should identify the last 'w' and then look for the digit immediately following it. If the last 'w' is indeed at the end of the string, the task as described doesn't apply because there's no digit after 'w' to print.\n\nGiven the string ends with \"...r1r\", the last 'w' is not at the end but somewhere before. Let's correct the understanding:\n\nThe string is \"w1r1i1i0r1i0i1r1r1i0r1i1w1i1i1i1i1r1i1r1i1r1i0r1i0r1r1r1i1i1i0i1r1r1r1i1i1r1i1r1i1i0i1r1r1r1i0i0i1r1r1i1r1r1r1i1r1r1r1r1r1r1r1i0r1r1r1r1i1r1r1i1i0r1r\"\n\nUpon reevaluation, the last 'w' in the string is followed by '1'. \n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
