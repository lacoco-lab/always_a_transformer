The string contains two 'write' instructions: The first one is \"write0\" and the second one is also \"write0\".\n2. The last 'write' instruction is \"write0\".\n3. The character immediately after \"write0\" is '0'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the last 'write' instruction is '0'.\n\n<answer>0</answer>"}
