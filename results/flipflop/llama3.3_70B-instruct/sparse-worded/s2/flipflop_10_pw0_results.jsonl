The last occurrence of 'write' is at the beginning of the string.\n2. The position of 'write' is from index 0 to 5.\n3. The character immediately after 'write' is '1'.\n\nHowever, the task asks for the digit after the **last** 'write' instruction. Since there's only one 'write' in the string, the digit immediately after it is '1'. But to ensure we're following the instruction correctly in case of multiple 'write' occurrences, let's confirm there are no other 'write' instructions later in the string. Upon reviewing the string again, it's clear that 'write' appears only once, at the start.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the last 'write' instruction is indeed '1'.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
