Start from the end of the string and search for the last occurrence of 'write'.\n2. Once 'write' is found, look at the character immediately after it.\n\nGiven the input string: write1write1ignore0ignore1read\n\nStarting from the end and moving backwards:\n- The string ends with 'read'.\n- Moving backwards, we find 'ignore1', then 'ignore0', then 'write1', and finally 'write1' again at the beginning.\n- The last 'write' instruction is 'write1' which appears twice, but we're interested in the last occurrence of 'write' which is followed by '1'.\n- However, we need to consider if there's another 'write' after the first 'write1'. There is indeed another 'write1' after it, which means the last 'write' is actually the second 'write1'.\n- The digit immediately after the last 'write' (which is 'write1') is '1'.\n\nTherefore, the digit after the last 'write' instruction is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>"}
