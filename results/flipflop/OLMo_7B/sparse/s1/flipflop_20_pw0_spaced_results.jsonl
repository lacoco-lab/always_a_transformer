The last character before it is '0', and the character after the 'w' is also '0'. To get the digit, we need to extract the '0' character. \n\nTo extract the character, we can use string indexing. The index of the 'w' character is 4, and the index of the character before it is 3. We can extract the character at index 3 using the following code:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"w0i0i1i1w0i1w0i1i0r\"\nlast_w_index = input_string.index(\"w\") - 1\ndigit = input_string[last_w_index]\nprint(digit)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n0\n```\n\nTherefore, the digit after the last 'w' character in the input string is '0'."}
