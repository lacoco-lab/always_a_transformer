Here's the relevant part of the string: \"i1i1i1i1i1i0i1i0i0i1i1i0i1i1i0i0i1i0i1i0i1i0r0i1i1r0i1i0i0i0i1i0r0i1i1i0i1i1i1i0w1r1r1i1i1r1i0i0w0i1i1i1i0i0i0i0i0r\". The last digit before the 'w' character is 'r', and the last 'w' character is at the end of the string. Therefore, the last digit after the last 'w' character is the digit to the right of the 'r', which is '1'.\n\nSo, the output is: <answer>1</answer>"}
