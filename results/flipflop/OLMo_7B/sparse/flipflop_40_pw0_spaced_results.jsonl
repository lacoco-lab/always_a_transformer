Converting 'r' to integer gives 18, and the digit in the ones place is 8 (since 18 / 10 = 1 with remainder 8). Therefore, the digit after the last 'w' character is 8.\n\nHowever, the given input string has no 'w' character after the last 'w' character, so the last character after the last 'w' character is 'r'. The digit after the last 'w' character is 0, since the last character after the last 'w' character is '0'. Therefore, the output is <answer>0</answer>."}

Return the digit from the integer.\n\nThe last 'w' character's index is 20, and the characters after it are 'i0i1i0i0'. Converting this to an integer gives us 102400, and the digit after the last 'w' is 0. Therefore, the output is 0."}

Return the digit from the integer.\n\nThe last 'w' character's index is 15. The characters from the last 'w' character to the end of the string are 'r'. Converting 'r' to an integer gives us 97. The digit in the ones place is '7', which is the digit we need. Therefore, the output is '7' written as <answer>0</answer>."}
