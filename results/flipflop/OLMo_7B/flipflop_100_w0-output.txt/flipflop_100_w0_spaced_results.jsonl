To find the digit after the last 'w', we need to count backwards from the last 'w' character by skipping every third character (since there are three characters in each 'word'). The third character from the last 'w' is 'r', the fourth character is ' ', and the fifth character is 'i'. We can skip the 'i' character and count backwards from the 'r' character. The fifth character before 'r' is '1', so the digit after the last 'w' is '1'.\n\nHere's the count backwards from the last 'w':\n\n* 21: r\n* 19: r\n* 17: r\n* 15: r\n* 13: r\n* 11: r\n* 9: r\n* 7: r\n* 5: r\n* 3: r\n* 1: 1\n\nSo, the output digit is <answer>1</answer>."}
