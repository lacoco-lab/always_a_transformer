To find the last occurrence of 'r', we can use the method described in the task and then extract the character after it. Here's how we can do it step by step:\n\n1. Find the index of the last 'w' character in the input string:\n   ```\n   last_w_index = input_string.rindex('w')\n   ```\n   The result is `40`.\n\n2. Calculate the index of the last character after the 'w' character:\n   ```\n   last_character_index = last_w_index + 2\n   ```\n   The result is `57`.\n\n3. Extract the character at the last_character_index:\n   ```\n   last_character = input_string[last_character_index]\n   ```\n   The result is 'r'.\n\n4. The last digit after the last 'w' character is the last character's unit digit. To get the unit digit, we can convert the character to its ASCII code and then get the last digit of the result:\n   ```\n   last_digit = int(last_character, base=36) % 10\n   ```\n   The result is '5'.\n\nSo, the output is <answer>5</answer>."}
