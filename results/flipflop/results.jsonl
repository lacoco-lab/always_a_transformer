The last character of the string is 'r', and the character just before it is 'w'. Therefore, the last 'w' character is the fourth character from the beginning of the string. To find the digit after the last 'w', we need to look at the character which is just after the last 'w'. In this case, the character after the last 'w' is 'r', and the digit in the tenth position of the string is '1'. So, the digit after the last 'w' is '1'. However, as we are looking for the digit after the last 'w' character, we only need to consider the character which is immediately after the 'w' character. In this case, the character after the 'w' is ' ' (a space). The"}
