To find the digit after the last 'w' character, we need to find the index of the last 'w' character. The index of the second 'w' character is 1, and the string length is 3. The index of the last character is the length of the string minus the index of the character plus one, which is 2. The last character in the string is 'r', and the digit in the character is 5. To get the digit after the last 'w', we need to shift the digit to the right by 4 places (since there are 4 digits in the last character). The result is 0. Therefore, the output is 0."}
